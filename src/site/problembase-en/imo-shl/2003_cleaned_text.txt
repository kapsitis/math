Each positive integer $a$ undergoes the following procedure in order to obtain the number $d = d\left(a\right)$:

(i) move the last digit of $a$ to the first position to obtain the numb er $b$;
(ii) square $b$ to obtain the number $c$;
(iii) move the first digit of $c$ to the end to obtain the number $d$.

(All the numbers in the problem are considered to be represented in base $10$.) For example, for $a=2003$, we get $b=3200$, $c=10240000$, and $d = 02400001 = 2400001 = d(2003)$.)
