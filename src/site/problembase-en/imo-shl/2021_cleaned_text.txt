Two squirrels, Bushy and Jumpy, have collected 2021 walnuts for the winter. Jumpy numbers the walnuts from 1 through 2021, and digs 2021 little holes in a circular pattern in the ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of 2021 moves. In the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps the positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut $k$.

Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, on the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts $a$ and $b$ such that $a<k<b$.
The kingdom of Anisotropy consists of $n$ cities. For every two cities there exists exactly one direct one-way road between them. We say that a path from $X$ to $Y$ is a sequence of roads such that one can move from $X$ to $Y$ along this sequence without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct cities in Anisotropy. Let $N_{AB}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $A$ to $B$. Similarly, let $N_{BA}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $B$ to $A$. Prove that the equality $N_{AB} = N_{BA}$ holds if and only if the number of roads going out from $A$ is the same as the number of roads going out from $B$.

Let $n$ and $k$ be two integers with $n>k\geqslant 1$. There are $2n+1$ students standing in a circle. Each student $S$ has $2k$ neighbors - namely, the $k$ students closest to $S$ on the left, and the $k$ students closest to $S$ on the right.

Suppose that $n+1$ of the students are girls, and the other $n$ are boys. Prove that there is a girl with at least $k$ girls among her neighbors.

A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game on an infinite square grid. First the hunter fixes a colouring of the cells with finitely many colours. The rabbit then secretly chooses a cell to start in. Every minute, the rabbit reports the colour of its current cell to the hunter, and then secretly moves to an adjacent cell that it has not visited before (two cells are adjacent if they share an edge). The hunter wins if after some finite time either:

    the rabbit cannot move; or
    the hunter can determine the cell in which the rabbit started.

Decide whether there exists a winning strategy for the hunter.

Consider a checkered $3m\times 3m$ square, where $m$ is an integer greater than $1.$ A frog sits on the lower left corner cell $S$ and wants to get to the upper right corner cell $F.$ The frog can hop from any cell to either the next cell to the right or the next cell upwards.

Some cells can be sticky, and the frog gets trapped once it hops on such a cell. A set $X$ of cells is called blocking if the frog cannot reach $F$ from $S$ when all the cells of $X$ are sticky. A blocking set is minimal if it does not contain a smaller blocking set.

    Prove that there exists a minimal blocking set containing at least $3m^2-3m$ cells.
    Prove that every minimal blocking set containing at most $3m^2$ cells.
