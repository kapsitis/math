Combinatorics
In Lineland there are $n\geq1$ towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a left bulldozer (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a right bulldozer (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the $2n$ bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a left and right bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two towns, with $B$ to the right of $A$. We say that town $A$ can sweep town $B$ away if the right bulldozer of $A$ can move over to $B$ pushing off all bulldozers it meets. Similarly town $B$ can sweep town $A$ away if the left bulldozer of $B$ can move over to $A$ pushing off all bulldozers of all towns on its way.

Prove that there is exactly one town that cannot be swept away by any other one.
We say that a finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of points in the plane is balanced if, for any two different points $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is a point $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $AC=BC$. We say that $\mathcal{S}$ is centre-free if for any three different points $A$, $B$ and $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is no points $P$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $PA=PB=PC$.

(a) Show that for all integers $n\ge 3$, there exists a balanced set consisting of $n$ points.

(b) Determine all integers $n\ge 3$ for which there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of $n$ points.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Two players $A$ and $B$ play a game in which they take turns choosing positive integers $k \le n$. The rules of the game are:

(i) A player cannot choose a number that has been chosen by either player on any previous turn.
(ii) A player cannot choose a number consecutive to any of those the player has already chosen on any previous turn.
(iii) The game is a draw if all numbers have been chosen; otherwise the player who cannot choose a number anymore loses the game.

The player $A$ takes the first turn. Determine the outcome of the game, assuming that both players use optimal strategies.

In a company of people some pairs are enemies. A group of people is called unsociable if the number of members in the group is odd and at least $3$, and it is possible to arrange all its members around a round table so that every two neighbors are enemies. Given that there are at most $2015$ unsociable groups, prove that it is possible to partition the company into $11$ parts so that no two enemies are in the same part.
