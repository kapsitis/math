Let $\Gamma$ be a circle and let $d$ be a line such that $\Gamma$ and $d$ have no common points. Further, let $AB$ be a diameter of the circle $\Gamma$; assume that this diameter $AB$ is perpendicular to the line $d$, and the point $B$ is nearer to the line $d$ than the point $A$.

Find all functions $ f: \mathbb{N^{*}}\to \mathbb{N^{*}}$ satisfying
\[ \left(f^{2}\left(m\right)+f\left(n\right)\right) \mid \left(m^{2}+n\right)^{2}\]

Remark. The abbreviation $ \mathbb{N^{*}}$ stands for the set of all positive integers:
$ \mathbb{N^{*}}=\left\{1,2,3,...\right\}$.
By $ f^{2}\left(m\right)$, we mean $ \left(f\left(m\right)\right)^{2}$ (and not $ f\left(f\left(m\right)\right)$).

Let ${n}$ and $k$ be positive integers. There are given ${n}$ circles in the plane. Every two of them intersect at two distinct points, and all points of intersection they determine are pairwise distinct (i. e. no three circles have a common point). No three circles have a point in common. Each intersection point must be colored with one of $n$ distinct colors so that each color is used at least once and exactly $k$ distinct colors occur on each circle.
