Let $n$ be a positive integer. A sequence of $n$ positive integers (not necessarily distinct) is called full if it satisfies the following condition: for each positive integer $k\geq2$, if the number $k$ appears in the sequence then so does the number $k-1$, and moreover the first occurrence of $k-1$ comes before the last occurrence of $k$.

Player $A$ chooses a triple $(x,y,z)$ in $T$, and Player $B$ has to discover $A$'s triple in as few moves as possible. A move consists of the following: $B$ gives $A$ a triple $(a,b,c)$ in $T$, and $A$ replies by giving $B$ the number $\left|x+y-a-b\right |+\left|y+z-b-c\right|+\left|z+x-c-a\right|$.
