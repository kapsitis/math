A circle is called a separator for a set of five points in a plane if it passes through three of these points, it contains a fourth point inside and the fifth point is outside the circle. Prove that every set of five points such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic has exactly four separators.

A set $ S$ of points from the space will be called completely symmetric if it has at least three elements and fulfills the condition that for every two distinct points $ A$ and $ B$ from $ S$, the perpendicular bisector plane of the segment $ AB$ is a plane of symmetry for $ S$.

For a triangle $T = ABC$ we take the point $X$ on the side $(AB)$ such that $AX/AB=4/5$, the point $Y$ on the segment $(CX)$ such that $CY = 2YX$ and, if possible, the point $Z$ on the ray ($CA$ such that $\widehat{CXZ} = 180 - \widehat{ABC}$.

The numbers from 1 to $n^2$ are randomly arranged in the cells of a $n \times n$ square ($n \geq 2$). For any pair of numbers situated on the same row or on the same column the ratio of the greater number to the smaller number is calculated.

A game is played by $n$ girls ($n \geq 2$), everybody having a ball. Each of the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of players, is an arbitrary order, exchange the balls they have at the moment. The game is called nice nice if at the end nobody has her own ball and it is called tiresome if at the end everybody has her initial ball. Determine the values of $n$ for which there exists a nice game and those for which there exists a tiresome game.

For $n \geq 3$ and $a_{1} \leq a_{2} \leq \ldots \leq a_{n}$ given real numbers we have the following instructions:

- place out the numbers in some order in a ring;
- delete one of the numbers from the ring;
- if just two numbers are remaining in the ring: let $S$ be the sum of these two numbers. Otherwise, if there are more the two numbers in the ring, replace

Afterwards start again with the step (2). Show that the largest sum $S$ which can result in this way is given by the formula

\[S_{max}= \sum^n_{k=2} \begin{pmatrix} n -2 \\ [\frac{k}{2}] - 1\end{pmatrix}a_{k}.\]
Combinatorics
Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer. A path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ in the $xy$ plane is a chain of consecutive unit moves either to the right (move denoted by $E$) or upwards (move denoted by $N$), all the moves being made inside the half-plane $x \geq y$. A step in a path is the occurence of two consecutive moves of the form $EN$. Show that the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that contain exactly $s$ steps $(n \geq s \geq 1)$ is

A biologist watches a chameleon. The chameleon catches flies and rests after each catch. The biologist notices that:

    the first fly is caught after a resting period of one minute;
    the resting period before catching the $2m^\text{th}$ fly is the same as the resting period before catching the $m^\text{th}$ fly and one minute shorter than the resting period before catching the $(2m+1)^\text{th}$ fly;
    when the chameleon stops resting, he catches a fly instantly.


    How many flies were caught by the chameleon before his first resting period of $9$ minutes in a row?
    After how many minutes will the chameleon catch his $98^\text{th}$ fly?
    How many flies were caught by the chameleon after 1999 minutes have passed?
