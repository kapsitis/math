A sequence of real numbers $ a_{0},\ a_{1},\ a_{2},\dots$ is defined by the formula
\[ a_{i + 1} = \left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor\cdot \left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle\qquad\text{for}\quad i\geq 0; \]here $a_0$ is an arbitrary real number, $\lfloor a_i\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $a_i$, and $\left\langle a_i\right\rangle=a_i-\lfloor a_i\rfloor$. Prove that $a_i=a_{i+2}$ for $i$ sufficiently large.

The sequence $c_{0}, c_{1}, . . . , c_{n}, . . .$ is defined by $c_{0}= 1, c_{1}= 0$, and $c_{n+2}= c_{n+1}+c_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$. Consider the set $S$ of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ for which there is a finite set $J$ of positive integers such that $x=\textstyle\sum_{j \in J}{c_{j}}$, $y=\textstyle\sum_{j \in J}{c_{j-1}}$. Prove that there exist real numbers $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $M$ with the following property: An ordered pair of nonnegative integers $(x, y)$ satisfies the inequality \[m < \alpha x+\beta y < M\] if and only if $(x, y) \in S$.

Remark: A sum over the elements of the empty set is assumed to be $0$.
Prove the inequality:
\[\sum_{i < j}{\frac {a_{i}a_{j}}{a_{i} + a_{j}}}\leq \frac {n}{2(a_{1} + a_{2} +\cdots + a_{n})}\cdot \sum_{i < j}{a_{i}a_{j}}\]
for positive reals $ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$.

Combinatorics
We have $ n \geq 2$ lamps $ L_{1}, . . . ,L_{n}$ in a row, each of them being either on or off. Every second we simultaneously modify the state of each lamp as follows: if the lamp $ L_{i}$ and its neighbours (only one neighbour for $ i = 1$ or $ i = n$, two neighbours for other $ i$) are in the same state, then $ L_{i}$ is switched off; â€“ otherwise, $ L_{i}$ is switched on.
Initially all the lamps are off except the leftmost one which is on.

$ (a)$ Prove that there are infinitely many integers $ n$ for which all the lamps will eventually be off.
$ (b)$ Prove that there are infinitely many integers $ n$ for which the lamps will never be all off.
Let $P$ be a regular $2006$-gon. A diagonal is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of $P$. The sides of $P$ are also called good.
Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by $2003$ diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of $P$. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.
Let $ S$ be a finite set of points in the plane such that no three of them are on a line. For each convex polygon $ P$ whose vertices are in $ S$, let $ a(P)$ be the number of vertices of $ P$, and let $ b(P)$ be the number of points of $ S$ which are outside $ P$. A line segment, a point, and the empty set are considered as convex polygons of $ 2$, $ 1$, and $ 0$ vertices respectively. Prove that for every real number $ x$ \[\sum_{P}{x^{a(P)}(1 - x)^{b(P)}} = 1,\] where the sum is taken over all convex polygons with vertices in $ S$.

Alternative formulation:

Let $ M$ be a finite point set in the plane and no three points are collinear. A subset $ A$ of $ M$ will be called round if its elements is the set of vertices of a convex $ A -$gon $ V(A).$ For each round subset let $ r(A)$ be the number of points from $ M$ which are exterior from the convex $ A -$gon $ V(A).$ Subsets with $ 0,1$ and 2 elements are always round, its corresponding polygons are the empty set, a point or a segment, respectively (for which all other points that are not vertices of the polygon are exterior). For each round subset $ A$ of $ M$ construct the polynomial
\[ P_A(x) = x^{|A|}(1 - x)^{r(A)}. \]
Show that the sum of polynomials for all round subsets is exactly the polynomial $ P(x) = 1.$

A cake has the form of an $ n$ x $ n$ square composed of $ n^{2}$ unit squares. Strawberries lie on some of the unit squares so that each row or column contains exactly one strawberry; call this arrangement $\mathcal{A}$.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be another such arrangement. Suppose that every grid rectangle with one vertex at the top left corner of the cake contains no fewer strawberries of arrangement $\mathcal{B}$ than of arrangement $\mathcal{A}$. Prove that arrangement $\mathcal{B}$ can be obtained from $ \mathcal{A}$ by performing a number of switches, defined as follows:

A switch consists in selecting a grid rectangle with only two strawberries, situated at its top right corner and bottom left corner, and moving these two strawberries to the other two corners of that rectangle.
