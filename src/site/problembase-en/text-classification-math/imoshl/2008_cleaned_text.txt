\[ \frac {\left( f(w) \right)^2 + \left( f(x) \right)^2}{f(y^2) + f(z^2) } = \frac {w^2 + x^2}{y^2 + z^2} \]

Let $ S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be a set of real numbers. We say that a pair $ (f, g)$ of functions from $ S$ into $ S$ is a Spanish Couple on $ S$, if they satisfy the following conditions:
(i) Both functions are strictly increasing, i.e. $ f(x) < f(y)$ and $ g(x) < g(y)$ for all $ x$, $ y\in S$ with $ x < y$;

(ii) The inequality $ f\left(g\left(g\left(x\right)\right)\right) < g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)$ holds for all $ x\in S$.

Combinatorics
In the plane we consider rectangles whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and have positive length. Such a rectangle will be called a box. Two boxes intersect if they have a common point in their interior or on their boundary. Find the largest $ n$ for which there exist $ n$ boxes $ B_1$, $ \ldots$, $ B_n$ such that $ B_i$ and $ B_j$ intersect if and only if $ i\not\equiv j\pm 1\pmod n$.

In the coordinate plane consider the set $ S$ of all points with integer coordinates. For a positive integer $ k$, two distinct points $A$, $ B\in S$ will be called $ k$-friends if there is a point $ C\in S$ such that the area of the triangle $ ABC$ is equal to $ k$. A set $ T\subset S$ will be called $ k$-clique if every two points in $ T$ are $ k$-friends. Find the least positive integer $ k$ for which there exits a $ k$-clique with more than 200 elements.

Let $ n$ and $ k$ be positive integers with $ k \geq n$ and $ k - n$ an even number. Let $ 2n$ lamps labelled $ 1$, $ 2$, ..., $ 2n$ be given, each of which can be either on or off. Initially all the lamps are off. We consider sequences of steps: at each step one of the lamps is switched (from on to off or from off to on).

Let $ N$ be the number of such sequences consisting of $ k$ steps and resulting in the state where lamps $ 1$ through $ n$ are all on, and lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ are all off.

Let $ M$ be number of such sequences consisting of $ k$ steps, resulting in the state where lamps $ 1$ through $ n$ are all on, and lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ are all off, but where none of the lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ is ever switched on.
