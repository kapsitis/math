Real numbers $ a_{1}$, $ a_{2}$, $ \ldots$, $ a_{n}$ are given. For each $ i$, $ (1 \leq i \leq n )$, define
\[ d_{i} = \max \{ a_{j}\mid 1 \leq j \leq i \} - \min \{ a_{j}\mid i \leq j \leq n \} \]
and let $ d = \max \{d_{i}\mid 1 \leq i \leq n \}$.

(a) Prove that, for any real numbers $ x_{1}\leq x_{2}\leq \cdots \leq x_{n}$,
\[ \max \{ |x_{i} - a_{i}| \mid 1 \leq i \leq n \}\geq \frac {d}{2}. \quad \quad (*) \]
(b) Show that there are real numbers $ x_{1}\leq x_{2}\leq \cdots \leq x_{n}$ such that the equality holds in (*).

Let $ A_0 = (a_1,\dots,a_n)$ be a finite sequence of real numbers. For each $ k\geq 0$, from the sequence $ A_k = (x_1,\dots,x_k)$ we construct a new sequence $ A_{k + 1}$ in the following way.
1. We choose a partition $ \{1,\dots,n\} = I\cup J$, where $ I$ and $ J$ are two disjoint sets, such that the expression
\[ \left|\sum_{i\in I}x_i - \sum_{j\in J}x_j\right| \]
attains the smallest value. (We allow $ I$ or $ J$ to be empty; in this case the corresponding sum is 0.) If there are several such partitions, one is chosen arbitrarily.
2. We set $ A_{k + 1} = (y_1,\dots,y_n)$ where $ y_i = x_i + 1$ if $ i\in I$, and $ y_i = x_i - 1$ if $ i\in J$.
Prove that for some $ k$, the sequence $ A_k$ contains an element $ x$ such that $ |x|\geq\frac n2$.

In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strips $ S_n = \{(x,y)|n\le x < n + 1\}$, $ n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and color each strip black or white. Prove that any rectangle which is not a square can be placed in the plane so that its vertices have the same color.

IMO Shortlist 2007 Problem C5 as it appears in the official booklet:
In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strips $ S_n = \{(x,y)|n\le x < n + 1\}$ for every integer $ n.$ Assume each strip $ S_n$ is colored either red or blue, and let $ a$ and $ b$ be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side length $ a$ and $ b$ such that its vertices have the same color.

In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitiors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its size.

Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.
