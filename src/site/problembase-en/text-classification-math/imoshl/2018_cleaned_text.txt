Given any set $S$ of positive integers, show that at least one of the following two assertions holds:

Let $n\geqslant 3$ be an integer. Prove that there exists a set $S$ of $2n$ positive integers satisfying the following property: For every $m=2,3,...,n$ the set $S$ can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums of elements, with one of subsets of cardinality $m$.
A site is any point $(x, y)$ in the plane such that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers less than or equal to 20.

Initially, each of the 400 sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns placing stones with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red stones is not equal to $\sqrt{5}$. On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any other occupied site.) They stop as soon as a player cannot place a stone.

Find the greatest $K$ such that Amy can ensure that she places at least $K$ red stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.

Let $n$ be a given positive integer. Sisyphus performs a sequence of turns on a board consisting of $n + 1$ squares in a row, numbered $0$ to $n$ from left to right. Initially, $n$ stones are put into square $0$, and the other squares are empty. At every turn, Sisyphus chooses any nonempty square, say with $k$ stones, takes one of these stones and moves it to the right by at most $k$ squares (the stone should say within the board). Sisyphus' aim is to move all $n$ stones to square $n$.
Prove that Sisyphus cannot reach the aim in less than
\[ \left \lceil \frac{n}{1} \right \rceil + \left \lceil \frac{n}{2} \right \rceil + \left \lceil \frac{n}{3} \right \rceil + \dots + \left \lceil \frac{n}{n} \right \rceil \]turns. (As usual, $\lceil x \rceil$ stands for the least integer not smaller than $x$. )
An anti-Pascal triangle is an equilateral triangular array of numbers such that, except for the numbers in the bottom row, each number is the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers immediately below it. For example, the following is an anti-Pascal triangle with four rows which contains every integer from $1$ to $10$.
\[\begin{array}{ c@{\hspace{4pt}}c@{\hspace{4pt}} c@{\hspace{4pt}}c@{\hspace{2pt}}c@{\hspace{2pt}}c@{\hspace{4pt}}c } \vspace{4pt} & & & 4 & & & \\\vspace{4pt} & & 2 & & 6 & & \\\vspace{4pt} & 5 & & 7 & & 1 & \\\vspace{4pt} 8 & & 3 & & 10 & & 9 \\\vspace{4pt} \end{array}\]Does there exist an anti-Pascal triangle with $2018$ rows which contains every integer from $1$ to $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 2018$?

Let $k$ be a positive integer. The organising commitee of a tennis tournament is to schedule the matches for $2k$ players so that every two players play once, each day exactly one match is played, and each player arrives to the tournament site the day of his first match, and departs the day of his last match. For every day a player is present on the tournament, the committee has to pay $1$ coin to the hotel. The organisers want to design the schedule so as to minimise the total cost of all players' stays. Determine this minimum cost.
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers. The following infinite process takes place on an initially empty board.

    If there is at least a pair of equal numbers on the board, we choose such a pair and increase one of its components by $a$ and the other by $b$.
    If no such pair exists, we write two times the number $0$.

Prove that, no matter how we make the choices in $(i)$, operation $(ii)$ will be performed only finitely many times.

Consider $2018$ pairwise crossing circles no three of which are concurrent. These circles subdivide the plane into regions bounded by circular $edges$ that meet at $vertices$. Notice that there are an even number of vertices on each circle. Given the circle, alternately colour the vertices on that circle red and blue. In doing so for each circle, every vertex is coloured twice- once for each of the two circle that cross at that point. If the two colours agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least $2061$ yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.
