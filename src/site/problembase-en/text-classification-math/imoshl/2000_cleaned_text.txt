Let $ n \geq 2$ be a positive integer and $ \lambda$ a positive real number. Initially there are $ n$ fleas on a horizontal line, not all at the same point. We define a move as choosing two fleas at some points $ A$ and $ B$, with $ A$ to the left of $ B$, and letting the flea from $ A$ jump over the flea from $ B$ to the point $ C$ so that $ \frac {BC}{AB} = \lambda$.

Determine all values of $ \lambda$ such that, for any point $ M$ on the line and for any initial position of the $ n$ fleas, there exists a sequence of moves that will take them all to the position right of $ M$.
A nonempty set $ A$ of real numbers is called a $ B_3$-set if the conditions $ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 \in A$ and $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6$ imply that the sequences $ (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $ (a_4, a_5, a_6)$ are identical up to a permutation. Let $A = \{a_0 = 0 < a_1 < a_2 < \cdots \}$, $B = \{b_0 = 0 < b_1 < b_2 < \cdots \}$ be infinite sequences of real numbers with $ D(A) = D(B),$ where, for a set $ X$ of real numbers, $ D(X)$ denotes the difference set $ \{|x-y|\mid x, y \in X \}.$ Prove that if $ A$ is a $ B_3$-set, then $ A = B.$
For a polynomial $ P$ of degree 2000 with distinct real coefficients let $ M(P)$ be the set of all polynomials that can be produced from $ P$ by permutation of its coefficients. A polynomial $ P$ will be called $ n$-independent if $ P(n) = 0$ and we can get from any $ Q \in M(P)$ a polynomial $ Q_1$ such that $ Q_1(n) = 0$ by interchanging at most one pair of coefficients of $ Q.$ Find all integers $ n$ for which $ n$-independent polynomials exist.

Combinatorics
A magician has one hundred cards numbered 1 to 100. He puts them into three boxes, a red one, a white one and a blue one, so that each box contains at least one card. A member of the audience draws two cards from two different boxes and announces the sum of numbers on those cards. Given this information, the magician locates the box from which no card has been drawn.

How many ways are there to put the cards in the three boxes so that the trick works?
