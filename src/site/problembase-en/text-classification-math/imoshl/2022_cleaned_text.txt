Let $(a_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers with the property that
$$(a_{n+1})^2 + a_na_{n+2} \leq a_n + a_{n+2}$$for all positive integers $n$. Show that $a_{2022}\leq 1$.
Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. Find the smallest integer $n \ge k+1$ with the property that there exists a set of $n$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set.
Let $\mathbb{R}^+$ denote the set of positive real numbers. Find all functions $f: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ such that for each $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$, there is exactly one $y \in \mathbb{R}^+$ satisfying $$xf(y)+yf(x) \leq 2$$
Let $n \geqslant 3$ be an integer, and let $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ be real numbers in the interval $[0,1]$. Let $s=x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n$, and assume that $s \geqslant 3$. Prove that there exist integers $i$ and $j$ with $1 \leqslant i<j \leqslant n$ such that
\[2^{j-i}x_ix_j>2^{s-3}.\]
Find all positive integers $n \geqslant 2$ for which there exist $n$ real numbers $a_1<\cdots<a_n$ and a real number $r>0$ such that the $\tfrac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ differences $a_j-a_i$ for $1 \leqslant i<j \leqslant n$ are equal, in some order, to the numbers $r^1,r^2,\ldots,r^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}$.
Let $\mathbb R$ be the set of real numbers. We denote by $\mathcal F$ the set of all functions $f\colon\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that
$$f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(y)$$for every $x,y\in\mathbb R$ Find all rational numbers $q$ such that for every function $f\in\mathcal F$, there exists some $z\in\mathbb R$ satisfying $f(z)=qz$.
For a positive integer $n$ we denote by $s(n)$ the sum of the digits of $n$. Let $P(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ be a polynomial, where $n \geqslant 2$ and $a_i$ is a positive integer for all $0 \leqslant i \leqslant n-1$. Could it be the case that, for all positive integers $k$, $s(k)$ and $s(P(k))$ have the same parity?
For a positive integer $n$, an $n$-sequence is a sequence $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$ of non-negative integers satisfying the following condition: if $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers with $i+j \leqslant n$, then $a_i+a_j \leqslant n$ and $a_{a_i+a_j}=a_{i+j}$.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of $n$-sequences. Prove that there exist positive real numbers $c_1$, $c_2$, and $\lambda$ such that \[c_1\lambda^n<f(n)<c_2\lambda^n\]for all positive integers $n$.
Combinatorics
A $\pm 1$-sequence is a sequence of $2022$ numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_{2022},$ each equal to either $+1$ or $-1$. Determine the largest $C$ so that, for any $\pm 1$-sequence, there exists an integer $k$ and indices $1 \le t_1 < \ldots < t_k \le 2022$ so that $t_{i+1} - t_i \le 2$ for all $i$, and $$\left| \sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_{t_i} \right| \ge C.$$
The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminum (denoted A) and bronze (denoted B). Marianne has $n$ aluminum coins and $n$ bronze coins arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer $k \leq 2n$, Gilberty repeatedly performs the following operation: he identifies the longest chain containing the $k^{th}$ coin from the left and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if $n=4$ and $k=4$, the process starting from the ordering $AABBBABA$ would be $AABBBABA \to BBBAAABA \to AAABBBBA \to BBBBAAAA \to ...$

Find all pairs $(n,k)$ with $1 \leq k \leq 2n$ such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost $n$ coins will all be of the same type.
In each square of a garden shaped like a $2022 \times 2022$ board, there is initially a tree of height $0$. A gardener and a lumberjack alternate turns playing the following game, with the gardener taking the first turn:

    The gardener chooses a square in the garden. Each tree on that square and all the surrounding squares (of which there are at most eight) then becomes one unit taller.
    The lumberjack then chooses four different squares on the board. Each tree of positive height on those squares then becomes one unit shorter.

We say that a tree is majestic if its height is at least $10^6$. Determine the largest $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, no matter how the lumberjack plays.
Let $n > 3$ be a positive integer. Suppose that $n$ children are arranged in a circle, and $n$ coins are distributed between them (some children may have no coins). At every step, a child with at least 2 coins may give 1 coin to each of their immediate neighbors on the right and left. Determine all initial distributions of the coins from which it is possible that, after a finite number of steps, each child has exactly one coin.
Let $m,n \geqslant 2$ be integers, let $X$ be a set with $n$ elements, and let $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_m$ be pairwise distinct non-empty, not necessary disjoint subset of $X$. A function $f \colon X \to \{1,2,\ldots,n+1\}$ is called nice if there exists an index $k$ such that \[\sum_{x \in X_k} f(x)>\sum_{x \in X_i} f(x) \quad \text{for all } i \ne k.\]Prove that the number of nice functions is at least $n^n$.
Let $n$ be a positive integer. We start with $n$ piles of pebbles, each initially containing a single pebble. One can perform moves of the following form: choose two piles, take an equal number of pebbles from each pile and form a new pile out of these pebbles. Find (in terms of $n$) the smallest number of nonempty piles that one can obtain by performing a finite sequence of moves of this form.
Lucy starts by writing $s$ integer-valued $2022$-tuples on a blackboard. After doing that, she can take any two (not necessarily distinct) tuples $\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\ldots,v_{2022})$ and $\mathbf{w}=(w_1,\ldots,w_{2022})$ that she has already written, and apply one of the following operations to obtain a new tuple:
\begin{align*} \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}&=(v_1+w_1,\ldots,v_{2022}+w_{2022}) \\ \mathbf{v} \lor \mathbf{w}&=(\max(v_1,w_1),\ldots,\max(v_{2022},w_{2022})) \end{align*}and then write this tuple on the blackboard.

It turns out that, in this way, Lucy can write any integer-valued $2022$-tuple on the blackboard after finitely many steps. What is the smallest possible number $s$ of tuples that she initially wrote?
Let $n$ be a positive integer. A Nordic square is an $n \times n$ board containing all the integers from $1$ to $n^2$ so that each cell contains exactly one number. Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers is called a valley. An uphill path is a sequence of one or more cells such that:

(i) the first cell in the sequence is a valley,

(ii) each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and

(iii) the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.

Find, as a function of $n$, the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square.
