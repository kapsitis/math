Let $n$ be an integer greater than 2. A positive integer is said to be attainable if it is 1 or can be obtained from 1 by a sequence of operations with the following properties:

2.) Thereafter, additions and multiplications are used alternately.

3.) In each addition, one can choose independently whether to add 2 or $n$

4.) In each multiplication, one can choose independently whether to multiply by 2 or by $n$.

Cards numbered 1 to 9 are arranged at random in a row. In a move, one may choose any block of consecutive cards whose numbers are in ascending or descending order, and switch the block around. For example, 9 1 $\underline{6\ 5\ 3}$ $2\ 7\ 4\ 8$ may be changed to $9 1$ $\underline{3\ 5\ 6}$ $2\ 7\ 4\ 8$. Prove that in at most 12 moves, one can arrange the 9 cards so that their numbers are in ascending or descending order.

Ten points are marked in the plane so that no three of them lie on a line. Each pair of points is connected with a segment. Each of these segments is painted with one of $k$ colors, in such a way that for any $k$ of the ten points, there are $k$ segments each joining two of them and no two being painted with the same color. Determine all integers $k$, $1\leq k\leq 10$, for which this is possible.
A solitaire game is played on an $m\times n$ rectangular board, using $mn$ markers which are white on one side and black on the other. Initially, each square of the board contains a marker with its white side up, except for one corner square, which contains a marker with its black side up. In each move, one may take away one marker with its black side up, but must then turn over all markers which are in squares having an edge in common with the square of the removed marker. Determine all pairs $(m,n)$ of positive integers such that all markers can be removed from the board.
