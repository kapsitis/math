* These are assignments by Viesturs; they include proper planning, analyzing
stakeholders and interaction with the customer.* 


## <lo-summary/> What is "Final Presentation"


<div style="font-size:70%">

1. <red>**Orderly communication of statuses**</red> (assigned tasks are visible; we know who is responsible for doing what):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue> -- Backlog should be created by <red>October 18, 2019</red>. 
It should be kept in a current state and should match your Working Agreement. Will be checked occasionally.

presentation that outlines the "stories" being added):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue> -- Whenever an Iteration Review (November 1, 15, 29). 
3. **The contribution of each team member** (all contributions clearly attributed, 
traceable to the prototype, its documentation and other deliverables):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue> -- use version control such as Git. Keep other documents in a way specified in your Working Agreement.
It could be Git as well; it could be Google Docs, etc.
4. **The presentation (as files/delivarables)** (the "final" presentation slides/artefacts 
are done well actually match the product prototype being delivered)  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue> -- November 1, 15, 29 (for Iteration Reviews - presenting your user stories), 
Early December (presenting your final presentation)
5. **Final Presentation (as an activity)** (reflects professional standards in technical communication, avoids pitfalls and anti-patterns):

</hgroup>


# <lo-sample/> Requirements a.k.a. Functional Design

* Functional requirements answer the question: What the product or solution should do. 
* Large projects may have a separate list of requirements (traceable to the
customer communication) and the Functional Design. 
* You can start right with the Functional Design (and list
all your requirements there). 

[Functional Design template](https://uit.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2017/08/30/Functional%20Specification%20Document%20Template.docx)


## <lo-summary/> Major parts

<hgroup>

* Title; Document changes and approvals (tables).
* Project scope (what is covered by your solution and what is not).
* Explicit assumptions and risks. (Your solution may be affected by some factors not
under your control).


</hgroup>
<hgroup>

**Functional requirements:**

* Solution Overview (Actors/Roles in your system; how they will interact with your system)
* Data used in your solution


**Non-functional requirements:**

* Performance/speed
* Audit and logging
* Integrations with other systems (if any)

</hgroup>


# <lo-sample/> Technical Design

* Describe your implementation/architecture - what systems and components 
you will need and support. 
* How the users will interact with your system. 



## <lo-summary/> Tech.Design for a Web Resource (1-3)

1. Which client devices are typically used? HTML friendly for small screens?
2. Webpage hosting? Add to an existing website? On an independent server? 
3. How will you measure the user engagement? Which sections are most visited, who are the visitors. Google Analytics and other trackers.


## <lo-summary/> Tech.Design for a Web Resource (4-7)

4. What is the change management? Who is authorized to modify the content; how do they log in?
5. How it will be tested? QA for the content (for example, to avoid publishing unverified claims). Manual tests? Automated regression testing 
(to ensure some core functionality). 
6. Web-marketing approach. Social media posts? Asking your friends to link to your page? 
Shortened links/QRcodes to the entrypoint (or, perhaps, other parts).
7. Host it on a social networking platform such as Instagram of Facebook as well? Who updates the content there? 
How do you receive user feedback and measure their activity on your page?






# <lo-theory/> Proof of Concept

* "Proof of Concept" - verify early that the stuff you want to display works as you want.
* Try doing one core thing first.
* Test, if it really works as you want.

**Goal:** Address highest risks (show-stoppers) early. If you cannot get the Proof-of-Concept (POC) 
done, then you may need to reconsider your whole project.

# <lo-theory/> Proof of Concept: Examples

**Example 1:** If you plan to use a video, check if you can record (at least something 
very short and simple) and publish it in the media you wanted. See the resolution and other
qualities. 

**Example 2:** If you plan to support a voting system, check that you can deploy a simple
system (on somebody's laptop) that counts votes - even without proper authentication. 

**Example 3:** If you plan to integrate with some existing Webpage (for example, use
your solution in a school), ask, if the owners of the Website can give you the right privileges.


# <lo-theory/> POC: Check for Insufficient Skills

* The skills to carry something to the completion is also a part of the POC. 
* Check, if you have the right skills at a very specific level.

# <lo-theory/> Development and Proudction Environments

<hgroup>

**Development Environment**

* Can be checked out from Git. 
* Can be updated very often:  
`git clone repository-name`  
`git pull origin master`
* Experienced by developers.

</hgroup>
<hgroup>

**Production Environment**

* Updated in a controlled manner (product releases)
* Experienced by end users

Moving stuff from the development environment to 
the production environment is called **deployment** 
(similar to how armies or emergency services **deploy**
their forces to a new location). 

</hgroup>



## <lo-summary/> Each team will have development environment

* Majority of files needed for your product should go there
* **Except** some files which contain personal data or
other sensitive material. (Big IT companies use much safer
version control systems - they can check in everything). 

Sensitive files do not change often - you can copy them around 
with other means.

<th>From today to 2019-10-18</th> 
<td>Iteration 0. Proof of Concept is done. 
Development Environment exists for all developers (everyone
can access files to update content or software).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2019-10-18 ... 2019-11-01</th>
<td><b>Iteration 1:</b> (depends on your project)</td>
</tr>

<td><b>Iteration 3:</b> (depends on your project)</td>
</tr>
</table>





## <lo-summary/> Iterations for your Project

If your project has unusual release schedule, you can 
declare your intention to have different iterations - but you have to decide 
**before** October 18, 2019. Please inform all instructors
(Claudio, Viesturs, Kalvis) that your project will benefit from 
different planning. And send in your iterations (and approximate 
descriptions of the work done by each iteration).

# <lo-theory/> What is the MVP

**Definition**  (by Eric Ries - a consultant on startups): 

A minimum viable product (MVP) is the the most limited 
version of a product that can still be released. An MVP has three key characteristics:

* It has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it.
* It demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.
* It provides a feedback loop to guide future development.

The MVP technique assumes that early adopters can see the 
vision or promise of the final product and provide their feedback. 
Feedback is essential to move ahead.
