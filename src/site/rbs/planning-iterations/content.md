# <lo-why/> why

<div class="bigWhy">

Why plan the iterations?

</div>
<div class="smallWhy">

* Deliver functionality after each iteration. 
* Preserve flexibility in your projects. 

</div>







## <lo-summary/> Our Plan for Today

* Functional Design - Some presentations
* Technical Design - Some presentations
* Proof of Concept (POC) - Some presentations
* Your Iteration Plans







# <lo-theory/> Grading in the Syllabus

* Prototype: 300 points (The product and its technical implementation; mostly Kalvis)
* Class contribution: 200 points (various assignments and evaluations: mostly Claudio and Kalvis)
* Team Progress Reports (4 x 50): 200 points (Business Development perspective: mostly Viesturs)
* Final presentation 300 points (Delivering the product including progress reports: All 3 instructors)

Most items are graded for the team; some individual grades. 


## <lo-summary/> Prototype (How to split 300 pts?)

<div style="font-size:70%">

1. <red>**Functional Design**</red> (as Document by November 15):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>.
2. <red>**Technical Design**</red> (as Document by November 15): <blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>
3. **Review of Iteration 1** (presented near November 22):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>
4. **Review of Iteration 2** (presented near December 6): <blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>
3. **Development/Production Environments** (the ease of project configuration; before December 11):  
<blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>. 
4. **Testing, audit and measurability** (before December 11): <blue>**up to 50 points**</blue>.

</div>

## <lo-summary/> What is "Class contribution"

1. **Working Agreement**: <blue>**up to 20 points**</blue> - update this.  
2. **Tools and Methods for Productivity**: <blue>**up to 30 points**</blue> (individual plan to learn some
simple skill to make your project work more efficient) - skill wishlists already submitted
3. **Agile Development Process**: <blue>**up to 50 points**</blue> - Small reading assignments about the software engineering 
best practices. (Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process. Addison-Wesley.)

Up to 100 points awarded by Claudio.



## <lo-summary/> Progress Reports and Final Presentation

* Assignments by Viesturs
* December 11 - the big event. 

Will be discussed by Kalvis and Viesturs on November 22. 







# <lo-soln/> Functional Design: How is it Evaluated

<div style="font-size:80%">

1. Project scope is described exactly: What is (and what is not) part of your overall goal. 
2. Dependencies, integrations with other systems. 
3. Functions/Use-cases are clearly documented (descriptions and relevant
screenshots and wireframes). For each function you specify "primary actors" 
(who are the people who will perform this function or use-case).
4. "Non-functional" requirements, if applicable: Accessibility (phones? browsers?); 
auditability; backups; data quality; performance; security. 

**Note:** Your Functional Design might have other parts as well - depending on your project.

</div>




# <lo-sample/> Technical Design: How is it Evaluated

* Computer hardware (and other hardware) requirements, if applicable.
* Software requirements for system running your project - Operating System; preinstalled software, network, etc. 
* What should be the initial configuration of your software; which files to copy, how to initialize the database.
* What happens as you run the system. 





## <lo-sample/> Peer-reviews of Design Docs

<div style="font-size:80%">

**Education and Civil Society:**

1. Bauska Youth Development Program 
2. Bauska Career Navigator
3. Vote Bauska

**Municipality Projects and Activities:**

1. ProView (displaying projects)
2. Make Bauska Great Again (voting for projects)
3. Bunch of Bricks (email notifications)

**Tourism:**

1. EduBauska (Maps with objects for tourists)
2. Bauska, Move! (QR Codes; velo-tourism)
3. Bauska Live (promotional video for tourism)

</div>


## <lo-sample/> Deliverable: 

1. Can be one document per team you are reviewing 
(can combine feedback of Technical and Functional designs.
