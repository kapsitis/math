# <lo-why/> why

<div class="bigWhy">

Why plan the iterations?

</div>
<div class="smallWhy">

* Deliver functionality after each iteration. 
* Preserve flexibility in your projects.

# <lo-soln/> Functional Design: How is it Evaluated

<div style="font-size:80%">

1. Project scope is described exactly: What is (and what is not) part of your overall goal. 
2. Dependencies, integrations with other systems. 
3. Functions/Use-cases are clearly documented (descriptions and relevant
screenshots and wireframes). For each function you specify "primary actors" 
(who are the people who will perform this function or use-case).
4. "Non-functional" requirements, if applicable: Accessibility (phones? browsers?); 
auditability; backups; data quality; performance; security. 

**Note:** Your Functional Design might have other parts as well - depending on your project.

</div>




# <lo-sample/> Technical Design: How is it Evaluated

* Computer hardware (and other hardware) requirements, if applicable.
* Software requirements for system running your project - Operating System; preinstalled software, network, etc. 
* What should be the initial configuration of your software; which files to copy, how to initialize the database.
* What happens as you run the system. 





## <lo-sample/> Peer-reviews of Design Docs

<div style="font-size:80%">

**Education and Civil Society:**

1. Bauska Youth Development Program 
2. Bauska Career Navigator
3. Vote Bauska

**Municipality Projects and Activities:**

1. ProView (displaying projects)
2. Make Bauska Great Again (voting for projects)
3. Bunch of Bricks (email notifications)

**Tourism:**

1. EduBauska (Maps with objects for tourists)
2. Bauska, Move! (QR Codes; velo-tourism)
3. Bauska Live (promotional video for tourism)

</div>


## <lo-sample/> Deliverable: Peer-Review

1. Can be one document per team you are reviewing 
(can combine feedback of Technical and Functional designs. 
2. Point out the places, which are not easy to understand; 
contradictions between the documents.

## <lo-summary/> Timeboxing, Iterations and Sprints

* **Timeboxing** is a management approach - defining intermediate goals/milestones.
* **Iteration** means running similar procedure multiple times (it does NOT mean
<blue>*Same story, different day*</blue>). The story changes by every iteration, but there are repetitive
parts - just like trying out 3 different palace doors in a fairy tale. 
* **Sprint** means planning and executing a software iteration according to <blue>**Agile**</blue> methodology 
(NOT mandatory for you, but recommended). 


## <lo-summary/> Benefits of Iterations/Sprints

* Ease of planning (can you plan **in advance** every step how do you walk to the Riga Central Railway Station?)
* Fast feedback (can adapt and learn)
* Bounded errror (mistakes do not ruin the entire project)
* Improved return of investment (can deliver early)
* More frequent excitement and checkpoints (can stretch/challenge your ability multiple times and see how it works).



## <lo-summary/> Iteration Guidelines

* You create the Backlog (global TODO list of your project).
* You plan to deliver **some** of the project's functions and also **some** other necessary tasks (mark them in the Backlog).
* You assign 1-2 people who are responsible for each little task; check with them on frequent basis (Daily Standups)
* You <red>CANNOT</red> extend the Iteration/the Timebox. 
* You <red>CAN</red> find out that some tasks are incomplete and carry them over to the next iteration. 



## <lo-summary/> How Agile is Different

Agile/Scrum also does iterations, but it adds certain Sprint Activities

* Daily Standup meetings (brief exchange of statuses; tell your results, your next step, your blockers)
* Scrum planning meeting (decide carefully, which things you will prioritize - typically by their value to the customer). 
* Assign "story points" to the tasks to evaluate their complexity (for example $1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots$ story points). 
* Scrum review and retrospective meetings. 




## <lo-sample/> Your Plannning Documents

* **Team Working Agreement:** How do you make decisions and follow up.
* **Requirements; Progress Reports** for Viesturs, and other high-level Business Development planning 
(your communication with customers; executive summaries). 
* **Functional Design:** Explain what functionality you support (functional requirements) and in what context (non-functional 
requirements) - Meant for End-users
* **Technical Design:** Explain how you implement your functionality (for programmers, Bauska Website admins, etc).
* <red>**Project Backlog:**</red> Excel or other table with all tasks related to your project (mark current status; is it complete or when it is planned to be complete)
* <red>**Plan for Iteration 1:**</red> Your Milestone for November 22 - short description; goals and responsible people.

## <lo-sample/> Your Activities

* **Every Team:** Discuss your Iteration 1 (10 minutes) - Things you plan to 
do and to deliver from November 8 to November 22.
* **Every Team:** Tell your current status; Your plan for November 22; 
Existing or possible blockers. 
* **Volunteer Teams:** Iteration 0 Review: Present your Functional/Technical Design and existing POC.

Those who could not present it during our November 8 class, can arrange a meeting
(a quorum of 4 members can meet me during the next week and present the same **Before November 13**).

# <lo-theory/> What is due for November 15

* Iteration 0 Review: Present both design documents + POC (in class or to me)
* Two peer reviews for other teams (review their documents): Submit by **November 13 (ORTUS)**
* One person per team: Reads Chapters 3-4 (some 50 pages) from the "Essential Scrum", creates a presentation with 5 slides (not counting title slide/summaries/TOC).
What do you find <blue>5 most interesting things about the Scrum Process</blue>; for each thing explain, why it is (or is NOT) applicable to your Team Project.
