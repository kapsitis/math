# <lo-why/> 

<div class="bigWhy">

Kāpēc jāpēta dati mājaslapās un sociālajos tīklos?

</div>
<div class="smallWhy">

* Kādus datus varam cerēt atrast Web lapās un sociālo tīklu portālos?
* Kas ir "influencer-literacy" ("ietekmeļu pratība")? 
* Ar ko YouTube ir īpašs sociālais tīkls?

</div>

::: notes

* 
* Ietekmeļu pratību parasti lieto kā sinonīmu medijpratībai 
(kā netikt manipulētam sociālajos tīklos). Bet arī pašiem ietekmeļiem 
jāpilnveido prasmes, viņiem ir savs "literacy".

# <lo-summary/> Technologies to trace users

* Cookies (*sīkdatnes*)
* Tracking pixels and 3rd party banners (*trešo pušu izvietotie pikseļi un reklāmas baneri*)
* Browser fingerprinting (*pārlūkprogrammu digitālnospiedumi*)
* eBeacons (e-bojas - parasti Bluetooth vai ultraskaņas signāli)

[More about Website tracking](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/website-tracking/)

# <lo-summary/> If you own a platform

Google, Facebook and other platform owners can use all these technologies and 
get very detailed picture about their users.

## <lo-summary/> Schedules for teams

* Many participants, many teams, need to schedule, if you need undivided attention.
* Doing projects with iterations (short lecture).   
At other times - presenting deliverables.
* We'll need to discuss consultation times as soon as the process starts.


## <lo-summary/> Class culture

1. **Work agreement:** Team creates a simple list of guidelines (this time it 
should be written). 
2. "Daily Standup" - What is the information that we need from everyone in your team on a regular basis. The goal is to assist everyone with planning their activities.
3. Version control - all the files that are part of the solution should
be stored in a specific location (such as Git), where they 
can be **versioned**. This allows to do brave edits; at any moment 
there is "latest and greatest" set of files that can be shown to the customer.

* Motivation - WHY you are in the class; **Q17**
* Likes/dislikes about the course: **Q16-Q18**

# <lo-summary/> Misconceptions on IT teams

* The more urgent and complex is a task, the more resources 
(people, time) it will require.
* I do not object to managers as long as they are more competent than me.
* If we do not know what is going on with the project, we should meet more often.

# <lo-summary/> How IT can benefit business studies

**Number sense**

* Reading from charts
* Units of measurement
* Errors of measurement
* How it was aggregated
* What is the amount from which percentages were calculated?


## <lo-theory/> Percentages FROM something

* If a stock price falls by 95% - it equals a fall by 90% followed 
by a fall by 50%. (*A joke about some crappy investment*)

* If GDP grows by 10%, then falls by 10%, what is the total change? 




## <lo-theory/> Mean vs. Median

* "Natural" data (such as heights) is often normally distributed
* Income is very unevently distributed, there are *outliers*
* Test results (in history, etc.) depend on many small contributing
factors - closer to normally distributed.

# <lo-summary/> Searching with Google

* Selecting keywords (look up in a thesaurus).   
Keyword for these techniques is SEO (search engine optimization). 
* Use Boolean logic, quoted phrases, wildcards.
* Use special syntax: [https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/)
* Refine your searches.
* Apply multi step tactics: [http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/2228/paper.pdf](http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/2228/paper.pdf)
* Use other resources (besides dictionaries - Wikipedia - Google).


## <lo-summary/> Google Search: Solutions

* <blue>`"Mellow fruitfulness" -Keats`</blue>
* <blue>`(agile OR scrum) project management filetype:ppt OR filetype:pptx`</blue>
* <blue>`Betula Pendula site:lv`</blue>

* `(agile OR scrum) project management (filetype:ppt OR filetype:pptx)`   
Would return only PPT files (not PPTX).
* <blue>`Agile Scrum PPT Presentation`  
many false positives, others missing
* `Betula Pendula :lv`    
might work just because keyword "LV" is uncommon outside
Latvia. (Try `:se` to see that you typically do NOT get Swedish sites).
