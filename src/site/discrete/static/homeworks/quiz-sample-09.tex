\section{Worksheet 9: Advanced Counting}

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 1 (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q4).} 
Denote by $a_n$ the number of ways to go down an $n$-step staircase if you go down $1$, $2$, or $3$ steps at a time.
(In other words, $a_n$ denotes the number of ways how $n$ can be expressed as a sum of $1,2,3$, if the
order in the sum matters.)\\
Define $a_n$ as a recurrent sequence. Assume that the sequence starts from $a_1$. 

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 2 (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q11).}
A vending machine accepts only \$1 coins, \$1 bills, and \$2 bills. Let $a_n$ denote the
number of ways of depositing $n$ dollars in the vending machine, where the order in which the coins and bills
are deposited matters.\\
{\bf (A)} Find a recurrence relation for $a_n$ and give the necessary initial condition(s).\\
{\bf (B)} Find an explicit formula for $a_n$ by solving the recurrence relation in part {\bf (A)}.

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 3 (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q16-Q20).}
For each item solve the recurrence relation (characteristic equation 
or simply guess the pattern for the terms):\\
{\bf (A)} $a_n = a_{n-2}$, $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = -1$.\\
{\bf (B)} $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$, $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 1$.\\
{\bf (C)} $a_n = 3na_{n-1}$, $a_0 = 2$.\\
{\bf (D)} $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3n$, $a_0 = 5$.\\
{\bf (E)} $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 5$, $a_0 = 3$.

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 4 (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q24)}
Assume that the characteristic equation for a homogeneous 
linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients
is $(r + 2)(r + 4)^2 = 0$.\\
{\bf (A)} Describe the form for the general solution to the recurrence relation.\\
{\bf (B)} Define a recurrent sequence that leads to this characteristic equation.


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 5 (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q27)} 
The Catalan numbers $C_n$ count the number of strings of $n$ pluses ($+$) and $n$ minuses ($-$)
with the following property: as each
string is read from left to right, the number of pluses encountered is always 
at least as large as the number of minuses.\\
{\bf (A)} Verify this by listing these strings of lengths $2$, 
$4$, and $6$ and showing that there are $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ of
these, respectively.\\
{\bf (B)} Explain how counting these strings is the same as counting 
the number of ways to correctly parenthesize strings of variables.

{\em Note.} Catalan numbers 
$$C_0=1,\; C_1=1,\; C_2=2,\; C_3=5,\; C_4=14,\ldots$$
are defined as ${\displaystyle C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}}$.

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 6  (Rosen7e, Ch.8, Q28, Q29)}\\
{\bf (A)} What form does a particular solution of the linear nonhomogeneous 
recurrence relation $a_n = 4a_{n-1} - 4a_{n-2} + F(n)$ have when $F(n) = 2^n$?\\
{\bf (B)} What form does a particular solution of the linear nonhomogeneous 
recurrence relation $a_n = 4a_{n-1} - 4a_{n-2} + F(n)$ have when $F(n) = n2^n$?


 

\vspace{10pt}

\subsection{Answers}

\vspace{10pt} 
{\bf Question 1.} For staircases with $n = 1,2,3$ steps we 
can enumerate all possible sums and count them.\\
$1$-step staircases: $1$.\\
$2$-step staircases: $1+1$, $2$.\\
$3$-step staircases: $1+1+1$, $1+2$, $2+1$, $3$.

$$\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
a_1 = 1, \\
a_2 = 2, \\
a_3 = 4, \\
a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3},\;n \geq 4.\\
\end{array} \right.$$

Why $a{n}$ can be expressed as sum of $a_{n-1}$, $a_{n-2}$, $a_{n-3}$?\\
Let us consider the first movement downstairs. It can be either $1$ step down (then the 
remaining steps can be made in $a_{n-1}$ different ways), or $2$ steps down 
(then the remaining steps can be made in $a_{n-2}$ different ways),
or $3$ steps down (then the remaining steps can be made in $a_{n-3}$ different ways). 

All these options do not intersect (since any moving downstairs starts with either $1$, $2$ or $3$), 
therefore we simply add all these ways together: $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.



\vspace{10pt} 
{\bf Question 2.}\\
{\bf (A)} Let us find the initial conditions (values $a_1$ and $a_2$) and
the recurrence relation (how to express $a_n$ via the the two previous values).
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
a_1 = 2, \\
a_2 = 5, \\
a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} + a_{n-2},\;n \geq 3.\\
\end{array} \right.$$
The initial conditions can be verified by noticing that 1 dollar can be paid in two ways
(a coin or a bill); 2 dollars can be paid in five ways 
(either one \$2 bill or any of the following: coin+coin, coin+bill, bill+coin, bill+bill).\\
If $n \geq 3$, then $a_n$ either starts by a \$1 coin (plus paying the remaining sum in $a_{n-1}$ different ways)
or by a \$1 bill (plus paying the remaining sum in $a_{n-1}$ different ways), or by 
a \$2 bill (plus paying the remaining sum in $a_{n-2}$ different ways).
By adding together these mutually exclusive options we get
$$a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} = 2a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}.$$


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 3.} \\
{\bf (A)} Characteristic equation: $r^2 - 1 = 0$. 
The roots are $r_1 = -1$ and $r_2 = 1$. 
So, the general form of this sequence is 
$$a_n = A \cdot (-1)^n + B \cdot 1^n.$$
To get $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = -1$, we need $A = \frac{3}{2}$
and $B = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore,
$$a_n = \frac{3}{2} \cdot (-1)^n + \frac{1}{2}.$$
This expression would generate our alternating
sequence 
$$2,-1,2,-1,2,-1,\ldots$$

{\bf (B)} The characteristic equation is 
$$r^2 - 2r - 2 = 0.$$
And the roots of this square equation are 
$r_{1,2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{3}$.

We need to find constants $A$ and $B$ such that the formula
$$a_n = A\cdot r_1^n + B\cdot r_2^n$$
is correct and we get $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$. 
By substituting $n=0$ and $n=1$ we get this system:
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
A + B = 0\\
A(1 + \sqrt{3}) + B(1 - \sqrt{3}) = 1\\
\end{array} \right.$$
We get that $B = -A$ and $2A\sqrt{3} = 1$. 
Therefore $A = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$ and 
$B = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$. 
The formula to compute $a_n$ is therefore this:
$$a_n = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\left(1 + \sqrt{3} \right)^n 
-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\left(1 - \sqrt{3} \right)^n.$$

By plugging into this formula numbers from $[0;10]$, 
we can compute the first members of the sequence:
$$0,1,2,6,16,44,120,328,896,2448,6688,\ldots$$

{\bf (C)} $a_n$ can be obtained from $a_0 = 2$, 
if we multiply $n$ times by $3$ (i.e.\ by $3^n$), 
and also by $1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot n = n!$. 
Therefore, we get
$$a_n = 2 \cdot 3^n \cdot n!.$$

{\bf (D)} $a_n$ can be obtained from $a_0 = 5$ by 
adding some members of an arithmetic progression:
$$a_n = a_0 + (3 + 6 + \ldots + (3n)) = 5 + \frac{3n(n+1)}{2}.$$





\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 4}\\
{\bf (A)} $a_n = A\cdot(-2)^n + B\cdot(-4)^n + C\cdot n \cdot (-4)^4$.\\
{\bf (B)} $(r + 2)(r + 4)^2 = (r + 2)(r^2 + 8r + 16) = r^3 + 8r^2 + 16r + 2r^2 + 16r + 32 = r^3 + 10r^2 + 32r + 32$. 
From that cubic equation we can get this recurrent relationship: 
$$a_{n} = -10a_{n-1} - 32a_{n-2} - 32a_{n-3}.$$
Initial conditions (values for the first three members, say, $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ can be selected in any way).
