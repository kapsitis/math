{\bf Question 4.} Predicate $S(x, y, z)$ is true iff $x \cdot y = z$. 
Match six English sentences with six predicate expressions (like in the previous
exercise).


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 6.} We define three sets in the universe $U$ of ten integer numbers
between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive):
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}
K_2 & = & \{ x \in U \,\mid\, 2 \mid x \},\\
K_5 & = & \{ x \in U \,\mid\, 5 \mid x \},\\
K_7 & = & \{ x \in U \,\mid\, 7 \mid x \},
\end{array} \right.$$

Find the size of intersections ($A \cap B$ contains elements that are in {\bf both} 
$A$ and $B$), unions ($A \cup B$ contains elements that are at least in one
$A$ or $B$), set differences ($A - B$ contains elements that are in $A$, but not in $B$), 
complements ($\overline{A}$ contains elements that are in $U$, but not in $A$). 
In the examples below, $|X|$ denotes the number of elements in a set (its cardinality).


{\em Fill in your answer:}

\begin{tabular}{ll} \hline
$\left| K_2 \cup K_5 \right|$ & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
$\left| K_2 \cap K_7 \right|$ & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
$\left| \overline{K_7} \right|$ & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
$\left| \overline{K_2 \cap K_5} \right|$ & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}





\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 5.}
Find a counterexample to refute the following predicate expression:
$$(\exists x \in U\,P(x)) \wedge (\exists x\in U\,Q(x)) \rightarrow \exists x\in U\,(P(x) \wedge Q(x)).$$
Here $P(x)$ is true iff $P$ is a full square (a square of some integer number), 
$Q(x)$ is true iff $x$ is divisible by $5$, and $U$ is the set of all integers 
from the interval $[120;130]$.\\
Specify, what should be the value $x_1$ in the subexpression $(\exists x \in U\,P(x))$ 
and the value of $x_2$ in the subexpression $(\exists x \in U\,Q(x))$ to 
make the whole statement false.\\
{\em Note.} The three existential quantifiers in the formula may refer to 
three ``independent'', unrelated values of $x$ (bound variables are considered local to their expressions). 
If you feel confused by this, you can rewrite like this:
$$(\exists x \in U\,P(x)) \wedge (\exists y\in U\,Q(y)) \rightarrow \exists z\in U\,(P(z) \wedge Q(z)).$$
It means exactly the same thing.

{\em Fill in your answer:}
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
x_1 = \ldots\\
x_2 = \ldots
\end{array} \right.$$

\section{Answers}


{\bf Question 1.} Answer: 

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 2.} Answer: {\tt F,B,C,E,A,D}.\\
Assume that every predicate expression is a translation of some English sentence.
