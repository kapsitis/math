NOT AN ASSIGNMENT.

{\bf Problem 1} The $n$-th statement in a list of $100$ statements is
``Exactly $n$ of the statements in this list are false.'' 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What conclusions can you draw from these statements?
\item Answer part (a), if the $n$-th statement is ``At least $n$ of 
the statements in this list are false.''
\item Answer part (b) assuming that the list contains $99$ statements.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Problem 2 [19, p.24]} Each inhabitant of a remote village always tells the 
truth or always lies. A villager will give only a "Yes" or a "No" response
to a question a tourist asks. Suppose you are a tourist visiting this area and come
to a fork in the road. One branch leads to the ruins you want to visit; the
other branch leads deep into the jungle. A villager is standing at the fork in the road. 
What one question can you ask the villager to determine which branch to take?

{\bf Problem 3 [55, p.39]} 
Find a compound proposition logically equivalent to $p \rightarrow q$ using 
only the logical operator $\downarrow$.\\
{\em Note.} Operator $\downarrow$ is named {\bf Peirce arrow} (or NOR). 
Propositon $p \downarrow q$ is true when both $p$ and $q$ are false, and it is 
false otherwise. It is a shorthand: $p \downarrow q := \neg(p \vee q)$.

{\bf Problem 4 [39, p.114]} 
Let $S = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \cdots + x_ny_n$, where $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$
and $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n$ are orderings of two different sequences
of positive real numbers, each containing $n$ elements.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that $S$ takes its maximum value over all orderings of the two 
sequences when both sequences are sorted (so that the elements in each 
sequence are in nondecreasing order). 
\item Show that $S$ takes its minimum value over all orderings of the two 
sequences when one sequence is sorted into nondecreasing order and the other 
is sorted into nonincreasing order.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Problem 5 [39, p.119]} 
Prove or disprove that for any positive integers $a,b$:\\
If neither logarithm $\log_a b$ or $\log_b a$ is an integer, 
then at least one of them is irrational. 

\vspace{2ex}
{\bf Problem 6 [43, p.133]}
Prove or disprove that if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then 
$\mathcal{P}(A \times B) = \mathcal{P}(A) \times \mathcal{P}(B)$.

\vspace{2ex}
{\bf Problem 7 [78, p.164]}
Let $x$ be a real number. Show that 
$\lfloor 3x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor x + \frac{1}{3} \rfloor +
\lfloor x + \frac{2}{3} \rfloor$.

\vspace{2ex}
{\bf Problem 8 [28, p.179]}
Let $a_n$ be the $n$-th term of the sequence $1, 2,2, 3,3,3, 4,4,4,4, 5,5,5,5,5, 6,6,6,6,6,6,\ldots$
constructed by including the integer $k$ exactly $k$ times. Show that 
${\displaystyle \left\lfloor \sqrt{2n} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor}$. 


\vspace{2ex}
{\bf Problem 9 [31, p.187]}
Show that $\mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is countable by showing that
the polynomial function $f\,:\,\mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{Z}^{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
with ${\displaystyle f(m,n) = \frac{(m+n-2)(m+n+2)}{2} + m}$ is one-to-one and onto.

\vspace{2ex}
{\bf Problem 10}
We define the {\bf ``Binary base'' numbers} 
by setting $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 2$. 
Furthermore, after determining about all integers up 
to $n$ ($1,2,\ldots,n-1$) whether they are ``Binary base'' 
numbers or not, we set $n$ equal to the next ``Binary base'' 
number, if it {\bf cannot} be expressed by adding together
one or more of the previous ``Binary base'' numbers.\\
{\bf (a)} Prove that there are infinitely many ``Binary base'' 
numbers.\\
{\bf (b)} Find $b_{2020}$ \textendash the ``Binary base'' 
number which is the $2020^{\mbox{th}}$ member in that sequence.
