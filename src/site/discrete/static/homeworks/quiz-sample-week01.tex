{\bf Question 1.} Fill in the missing entries in the truth table of this proposition:
$$\neg(r \rightarrow \neg q) \vee (p \wedge \neg r).$$

TODO

{\bf Question 2.} Find the Boolean expression that has the truth table given below:

\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
$p$ & $q$ & ? \\ \hline
{\tt T} & {\tt T} & {\tt F} \\ \hline
{\tt T} & {\tt F} & {\tt T} \\ \hline
{\tt F} & {\tt T} & {\tt T} \\ \hline
{\tt F} & {\tt F} & {\tt F} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

{\em (Select 1 answer):}
(You can use only conjunctions and negations to build answers.)



Find, which is equivalent to the given proposition. 
Determine whether the following two propositions are logically equivalent: p → (¬q ∧ r), ¬p ∨ ¬(r → q).



Not eating vegetables is sufficient for not getting ice cream. 





Translate the given statement into propositional logic using the propositions provided: On certain highways
in the Washington, DC metro area you are allowed to travel on high occupancy lanes during rush hour only
if there are at least three passengers in the vehicle. Express your answer in terms of r:“You are traveling
during rush hour.” t:“You are riding in a car with at least three passengers.” and h:“You can travel on a high
occupancy lane.”




On the island of knights and knaves you encounter two people, A and B. Person A says “B is a knave.”
Person B says “At least one of us is a knight.” Determine whether each person is a knight or a knave.
Exercises 51–53 relate to inhabitants of an island on which there are three kinds of people: knights who always
tell the truth, knaves who always lie, and spies who can either tell the truth or lie. You encounter three people,
A, B, and C. You know one of the three people is a knight, one is a knave, and one is a spy. Each of the three
people knows the type of person each of the other two is. For each of these situations, if possible, determine
whether there is a unique solution, list all possible solutions or state that there are no solutions.
51. A says “I am not a knight,” B says “I am not a spy,” and C says “I am not a knave.”
52. A says “I am a spy,” B says “I am a spy” and C says “B is a spy.”
53. A says “I am a knight,” B says “I am a knave,” and C says “I am not a knave.”



Determine whether the compound propositions in 58–59 are satisfiable.
58. (¬p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (p → q)
