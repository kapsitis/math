\maketitle

{\bf Question 1.} Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ be two positive integers.
Translate into predicate logic: ``$d$ is the greatest common divisor 
of $a,b$.'' (That is, 
the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$).\\
{\em Note 1.} "Translate into predicate logic" means - use
predicates and quantifiers to express that statement.
{\em Note 2.} Use ``infix'' notation for common predicates: write 
$a\,\mid\,b$ whenever $a$ divides $b$; write $x < y$, if $x$ is less than $y$. For example, $3\,|\,6$ \hspace{1ex} 
($3$ divides $6$) is preferred compared to 
``$\mathtt{divides}(3,6)$''. Also \hspace{1ex} 
$10 < 17$ is more readable than
``$\mathtt{lessThan(10,17)}$''.

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 2.} Use quantifiers to write a 
statement to tell that a quadratic
function $f(x) = ax^2 +bx+c$ 
has two different integer roots.


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 3.} Assume that for some argument {\tt x}, 
Python functions {\tt a(x)} and {\tt b(x)}
return value {\tt True}, but other two functions 
{\tt c(x)} and {\tt d(x)} return value {\tt False}. 
Which functions are called and evaluated, if you run the following conditional statement:
\begin{verbatim}
if (a(x) or b(x)) and (c(x) & d(x)):
    ## ... some Python code ...
\end{verbatim}
{\em Note.} Note that Boolean operators {\tt and}, {\tt or} 
use {\em short-circuit
evaluation}, but operators {\tt \&}, {\tt |} do not. 


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 4.} There is a set $C$ of several children and a 
set $H$ of several hats. There is a predicate $W(c,h)$ which is {\tt True}
iff the child $c \in C$ has ever worn the hat $h \in H$.\\
{\bf (a)} Write the domain set and the range set of the predicate function $W$. \\
{\bf (b)} Use quantifiers to write a statement: ``Every two 
children have at least one hat in common (that is, both of 
them have worn it).''


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 5.}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the set of all humans, and the predicate $F(x,y)$ is
true iff $x$ is the father of $y$. Express these sentences in plain English:\\
{\bf (a)} $\forall y \in \mathcal{H}\;\exists x \in \mathcal{H},\;F(x,y)$.\\
{\bf (b)} $\exists x \in \mathcal{H}\;\forall y \in \mathcal{H},\;F(x,y)$.\\
{\bf (c)} Which of the two statements {\bf (a)}, {\bf (b)} (if any) 
is true, if we replace the non-empty domain of all humans $\mathcal{H}$ by an
empty domain $\mathcal{Z} = \emptyset$ of all zombies?

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 6.} We define predicates $P(x,y)$, 
$Q(x,y)$ with two arguments, 
where $x,y$ can be any of the three letters: 
$\mathtt{a},\mathtt{b},\mathtt{c}$. 
(The type for all these predicates is 
$\{ \mathtt{a},\mathtt{b},\mathtt{c} \}^2 
\rightarrow \{ \mathtt{T},\mathtt{F} \}$.)

They have these following truth tables:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
$P$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\ \hline
$a$ & $\mathtt{T}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{T}$ \\
$b$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ \\
$c$ & $\mathtt{T}$ & $\mathtt{T}$ & $\mathtt{T}$
\end{tabular}
\hspace{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
$Q$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\ \hline
$a$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{T}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ \\
$b$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{T}$ \\
$c$ & $\mathtt{T}$ & $\mathtt{F}$ & $\mathtt{F}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Find the truth values of these statements:\\
{\bf (a)} $\exists x \forall y, P(y,x)$\\
{\bf (b)} $\exists x \forall y, P(x,y)$\\
{\bf (c)} $\exists x \exists y, Q(x,y)$\\
{\bf (d)} $\forall x \exists y, Q(x,y)$\\
{\em Note.} In all truth tables the first argument is
represented by row, the second is represented by column. 
For example $P(\mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}) = \mathtt{F}$ (2nd row
and 3rd column). Meanwhile 
$P(\mathtt{c}, \mathtt{b}) = \mathtt{T}$ (3rd row and 2nd column). 



\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 7.} 
For a real number $x$ we know that $\lfloor x \rfloor \neq 
\lfloor x + 0.5 \rfloor$. Write this statement in 
predicate logic without using any $\lfloor \ldots \rfloor$ 
notation. (Write instead that $x$ and $x+0.5$ have some integer number 
betwen $x$  and $x+0.5$.)\\
{\em Note.} By $\lfloor x \rfloor$ we denote the 
largest integer number that does not exceed $x$. 
For example $\lfloor 3.14 \rfloor = 3$, $\lfloor 17 \rfloor = 17$, 
$\lfloor -4.5 \rfloor = -5$.

\section{Answers}


{\bf Question 1.} Answer:
$$\boxed{\forall k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+},\;\left(k\,\mid\,a \wedge 
k\,\mid\,b\right)\,\rightarrow\,k \leq d.}$$
{\em Recite:} ``For all positive integers $k$, if $k$ divides 
both $a$ and $b$, then $k$ does not exceed 
$d = \operatorname{gcd}(a,b)$.''\\
This also means that $d$ is the largest number among all
common divisors of $a,b$ ({\em greatest common divisor}, GCD).\\
{\em Note:} In the above formula $a,b,d$ are ``free variables''
(they need to be assigned independently; and if 
$d \neq \operatorname{gcd}(a,b)$, then the statement is false). 
On the other hand, $k$ is a ``bound variable''. You can rename
$k$ into $x$ \textendash{} and nothing will change.

\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 2.} Answer:
\begin{align}
 & \exists x_1 \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\,\exists x_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\,
\forall x_3 \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}, \nonumber \\
 & \left( x_1 \neq x_2 \wedge f(x_1)=0 \wedge f(x_2) = 0 \right) \wedge \nonumber \\
\wedge & \left( f(x_3) = 0 \rightarrow x_3 = x_1 \vee x_3 = x_2 \right). 
\nonumber
\end{align}
{\em Recite:} ``There exist two positive integers $x_1,x_2$ 
such that they are different and 
both of them are roots of $f(x)=0$ and, 
furthermore, for any other root $x_3$, it 
equals either $x_1$ or $x_2$.''\\
{\em Note:} The above statement says that there are {\em exactly}
two roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. You can easily write a modified statement 
saying that the equation $f(x)=0$ has {\em at least} two roots \textendash{}
in this case you can skip the $x_3$ part. For quadratic equations it
is the same (since no equation has more than $2$ roots), but 
the idea expressed here is slightly different:
\begin{align}
 & \exists x_1 \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\,\exists x_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \nonumber \\
 & \left( x_1 \neq x_2 \wedge f(x_1)=0 \wedge f(x_2) = 0 \right). \nonumber 
\end{align}


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 3.} Answer:\\
\underline{The following functions are called: {\tt a(x)}, 
{\tt c(x)}, {\tt d(x)}.}\\
Function {\tt b(x)} is not called, because 
short-circuit operator {\bf or} 
skips the second argument in ``{\tt a(x) or b(x)}'', 
if the first argument is {\tt True}.







\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 4.} Answer: {\bf (a)}
$$\boxed{W\,:\,C \times H \rightarrow \{ \mathtt{T}, \mathtt{F} \}.}$$
{\em Note.} In Coq the set of ``True'' and ``False'' 
is denoted by {\tt Prop} or $\{ \mathtt{T}, \mathtt{F} \}$.\\
{\bf (b)} 
$$\boxed{\forall c_1 \in C \; \forall c_2 \in C \; \exists h \in H,
W(c_1,h) \wedge W(c_2,h).}$$
Every two
children have at least one hat in common (that is, both
of them have worn it).



\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 5.} Answers:\\
{\bf (a)} \underline{Every human has a father.}\\
{\bf (b)} \underline{There exists someone, who is the father of everyone.}\\
{\bf (c)} \underline{Both (a) and (b) are false for empty sets.}\\
Every time we write $\exists x \in \mathcal{Z}$
regarding anything (where $\mathcal{Z} = \emptyset$ \textendash{}
an empty set) it is false. 

On the other hand, this statement is {\tt True}: 
$$\forall x \in \mathcal{Z} \; \forall y \in \mathcal{Z},\; F(x,y) \equiv \mathtt{True}.$$
{\em Recite:} ``In the (empty) set $\mathcal{Z}$ of all 
zombies, any zomby is a father of any other zomby.''\\
{\em Note.} For empty domains we do not need to know anything 
about the predicate values, because their truth tables have
zero rows and zero columns. You can also safely state the negation:
``No zomby is a father of another zomby.''
$$\forall x \in \mathcal{Z} \; \forall y \in \mathcal{Z},\; \neg F(x,y) \equiv \mathtt{True}.$$


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 6.} Answers:\\
{\bf (a)} False. In the truth table of $P$, there is NO 
column (denoted by $x$) containing $\mathtt{T}$ in 
every row.\\
{\bf (b)} True. In the truth table of $P$ there is a row $x$ 
(it is the last row $x = \mathtt{c}$), containing
$\mathtt{T}$ in every column.\\
{\bf (c)} True. We can indeed make $Q(x,y)$ true, if we pick 
row and column. For example $Q(\mathtt{c},\mathtt{a}) = \mathtt{T}$.\\
{\bf (d)} True. For any row in the truth table of $Q$, 
we can find at least one $\mathtt{T}$ in some column. 


\vspace{10pt}
{\bf Question 7.} Answer:\\
$$\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, x < k \wedge x+0.5 \geq k.$$
In this example $\lfloor x \rfloor = k-1$, but
$\lfloor x+0.5 \rfloor = k$, so they are different.
