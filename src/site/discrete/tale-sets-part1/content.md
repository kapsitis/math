# <lo-summary/> Objectives

1. Sets, set operations.
2. Venn diagrams








# <lo-yellow/> Hashing and Dictionaries

> Sets may exist as data structures. If you insert elements into a set, 
then iterate over them, you may get them in a weird order. 

* May change the order. 
* Constant lookup time. 
* Hashing collisions. 

* CRC check. 
* MD5 hash. 
* SHA256 hash.

# <lo-yellow/> Can data structures serve as keys?

* Mutable strings as keys?
* Mutable lists as keys?
