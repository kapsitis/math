\begin{enumerate}

\item Draw an Euler diagram representing the classes of sequences 
represented in the homework 4, problem 4. 
Show examples of sequences that fall in various strange places on this diagram. 

\item Suggest that the participants demonstrate some set identity that
can only be disproved by analyzing elements that are outside all the sets. 

\item Draw some diagrams in the Cartesian product between the sets A,B,C
(on a rectangular grid). Ask the participants to describe - what is inside or outside the shaded regions
in the rectangle. 


\item Ask the remainder function to distribute playing cards between a larger Cartesian 
product - ask the participants to select, which functions do the job; which are surjective, 
which are not. \\
Or, perhaps, Cartesian products on remainder sets?

\item HW3, Prob3 (Stefans Dimza etc.) = {U} nevajag apzīmēt kopu papildinājumu.
