# # solution * * claim 1 (generalized attribute of division with 9): * * Each natural $n$ has a $$n \equiv S(n)\;(\operatorname{mod} 9)$$ relationship ($n$ is a congruent with its $(\operatorname{mod} 9)$ of digits.) Let's find out what class of congruence owns the $2012^{2012}$, or what is the remainder of that number divided by the $9$. We get: we $$2012^{2012} \equiv 5^{2012} \equiv 5^2 5^{2010} \equiv 25 \cdot (5^6)^{335} \equiv 25 \equiv 7 \pmod {9}$$ used Ayler's theorem: if $\operatorname{gcd}(a,9) = 1$, $a^{\varphi(9)} \equiv 1\ \pmod {9}$ where the $\varphi(9) = 6$ is the value of the Ayler function. Since $2012^{2012} \equiv 7 \pmod 9$, $s_1 = S(2012^{2012})$, $s_2 = S(S(2012^{2012}))$ and $s_3 = S(S(S(2012^{2012})))$ are also congruents with $7$ --. In other words, the number $s_3 = S(S(S(2012^{2012})))$ gives the remainder to the $7$ divided by the $9$, or the sum of $s_3$ digits gives the remainder to the $7$ divided by the $9$. Let's just say that $s_3 = S(S(S(2012^{2012})))$ equals $7$. To make sure, let's write out a series of statements: * * claim 2: * * the smallest natural number for the $n \equiv 7\ \pmod 9$ you want to $S(n) > 7$ is $79$. * proof: * We write out some of the smallest subsistence numbers that give the $7$ of balances divided by the $9$: it $$7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70, 79, \ldots$$'t easy to see that $79$ is the first number in this string for which the sum of digits is not $7$ but $16$. $\square$ * * statement 3: * * smallest natural number in the $n \equiv 7\ \pmod 9$ for which the $S(S(n)) > 7$ is $799999999$. * proof: * Find the smallest $n$ you want to $S(n) \equiv 7 \pmod 9$ but $S(n) > 7$. According to the previous claim, the lower amount of digits $S(n)$ to such a characteristic is $79$. The smallest number of digits in a number with a $79$ sum of nine digits. You can get the sum $79$ in two ways: $79 = 9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+7$ or $79 = 9+9+9+9+9+9+9+8+8$. The smallest nine-digit number is the one whose first digit is the smallest possible, i.e. “7”. Since the number may increase by no more than a $1$ as the number increases by $1$, it cannot occur that the smallest natural number in the $n$ (to which $n \equiv 7\;(\operatorname{mod} 9)$ and $S(S(n)) > 7$) will be with a number greater than $79$ because the number in the $79$ will be reached before the larger number. $\square$ * * claim 4: * * inequality in $S(2012^{2012}) < 8 \cdot 10^8 - 1$ is in effect. * proof: * Let's evaluate the number $2012^{2012}$ from above: in $$\begin{array}{l}
2012^{2012} < 2100^{2012} = 2100^2 2100^{2010} = 2100^2 (2100^3)^{670} = \\
= 441 \cdot 100^2 \cdot (9261 \cdot 10^6)^{670} < 441 \cdot 10^4 \cdot (10^{10})^{670} = \\
= 441 \cdot 10^4 \cdot 10^{6700} < 1000 \cdot 10^{6704} = 10^{6707}.\\
\end{array}$$, we have obtained that the decimal $2012^{2012}$ of a number contains no more than $6707$ digits because that number is less than $10^{6707}$. Therefore, the sum of the digits of this number cannot exceed $9 	\cdot 6707 = 60363$ because no digit is greater than $9$. This estimate of the amount of digits is much less than $8 \cdot 10^8 - 1$. $\square$ * According to claim 3, $S(2012^{2012}) < 799999999$. * According to claim 2, $S(S(2012^{2012})) < 79$. * According to claim 1, $S(S(S(2012^{2012}))) = 7$. * reply. * $S(S(S(2012^{2012}))) = 7$.

Anne and Beth play the following game. A natural number $k \geq 2$ is given. An integer $n \geq k$ is written on the board. Anna starts and then the players take turns making moves. In each move, the player deletes a number that is written on the board and instead writes a number in the $m’$, such that it $k \leq m' < m$, and that is a mutual primary number with a number in the $m$. A player who can't make a move loses. Number $n$ ($n \geq k$) is called good if Beth has a winning strategy but bad otherwise. Let's look at two whole numbers in $n,n^{\ast} \geq k$ with the characteristic that each primary number less than a $k$ divides the $n$ then and only if it divides the $n^{\ast}$. Prove that $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ are either both good or both bad.
