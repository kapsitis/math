# # solve the biggest possible number of guests is $21$.

Let us prove that more than $21$ guests will not be able to patient Kung. Let's say she's been patient with $22$ guests. So $22 \cdot 3 = 66$ candy has been spent. As Kung had $8 + 14 + 20 + 26 = 68$ candy at first, there are 68-66 = 2 candy left over. We note that each guest can be treated with no more than one “red poppy,” so at least $26 − 22 = 4$ “red poppy” should remain over. There's a contradiction, so the assumption is false, and you can't $22$ guests to Kung's patient. If she can't patient $22$ guests, neither can more, and $21$ has the highest possible number of guests.

Latvia, as in all euro area countries, has 1; 2; 5; 10; 20 and 50 cent coins in circulation.

For example, if you $S=7$ and $M=3$, one five and two one cent coins have been used and there are no other options. What is the smallest $M$ value for which such a $S$ value can be found that, knowing the $S$ and $M$ values, it is clearly impossible to determine the coin set used?

If $M=1$, one coin used should be determined unambiguously, as the $S$ must coincide with the value of the coin. Let's look at the case if $M=2$ and all possible amounts of two coin values: | with 1 | with 2 | with 5 | with 10 | with 20 or 50 | | ---------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | --------- | $1+1=2$ | $1+50=51$ | $2+2=4$ | | $10+10=20$ | | | $5+5=10$ | $2+5=7$ | $1+2=3$ | $5+10=15$ | $10+20=30$ | $20+20 = 40$ | $1+5=6$ | $20+50 = 70$ | | $2+10=12$ | $5+20=25$ | | $10+50=60$ | $1+10=11$ | $5+50=55$ | $1+20=21$ | $50+50 = 100$ | $2+50=52$ | | | | | | | as seen all possible amounts are different, so a set of coins can be determined unambiguously if $M=2$. 
# # solution the smallest $M$ value is $3$, is matched by $S=12$, and the different sets of coins can be $5 + 5 + 2$ and $10 + 1 + 1$. Let's prove it's the lowest possible 𝑀 value. If $M = 1$, one coin used should be determined unambiguously, as the $S$ must coincide with the value of the coin. Let's look at the case if you $M = 2$. Suppose there are two different ways to express a given amount with two coins, that is, $S = a_1 + a_2 = b_1 + b_2$. Without losing generality, we can assume that $a_1$ is the greatest value. If it coincides with one of the values $b_1$ or $b_2$, then the $a_2$ must coincide with the $b_2$ or $b_1$, respectively, so these coin sets will be the same. So the $b_1$ and $b_2$ values are less than the $a_1$ value. Let's note that of the given coin values 1; 2; 5; 10; 20 and 50, each subsequent value is at least twice the previous value. That means $a_1 \geq b_1 + b_2$. So equality is $a_1 + a_2 = b_1 + b_2$ impossible because the left side of equality is certainly bigger than the right side and our assumption is false.

# # the highest possible seven-digit number that meets the terms of the task is $4888884$. Let's justify that this is the highest number possible. The last digit of a number cannot be greater than the $4$ because the 6 th digit is twice the last digit (non-digit $2 \cdot 5 = 10$). Because a number must share $12$, it must share both $4$ and $3$. The second digit of a number cannot be $9$ because the $94$ does not share $4$ (a sign of division by $4$). So the number could be in the $\overline{48a8a84}$ form. To share a number with a $3$, the sum of its digits must share a $3$. So $4 + 8 + a + 8 + a + 8 + 4 = 32 + 2 \cdot a$ should share the $3$. For the seven-digit number to be the highest, the $a$ value must be as large as possible: * If $a=9$, non-$3$ $32 + 2 \cdot a = 50$; * If $a=8$, then $32 + 2 \cdot a = 48$, so the $a = 8$ and search number are $4888884$.

So of the first three businessmen, there are those who lie, and there are those who tell the truth.

So the truth is said by either the second or third businesswoman because their utterances are contradictory. In that case, it's one of the first three businessmen who tells the truth, so everyone else tells the truth and each has $7$ dots. The first three businesspeople have $7 + 2 + 2 = 11$ dots on their backs together.

# # Resolution the only valid number $x$ is $453$. Let's say there are no other valid numbers. We mark a number in the $x$ with a $\overline{abc}$. Because deleting the last digit results in a number in the $9$ that divides the $\overline{ab}$, the sum of the digits in that number $a+b$ shares the $9$. The amount cannot be $18$ or greater because the sum of all three digits is $12$. The amount value cannot be $0$ or $a=b=0$, but the $a$ is the first digit of the number. So the only option is that $a+b=9$. Because the sum of digits is $12$, or $a+b+c= 12$, we get you to $c = 3$. We designate a three-digit number that is written in reverse order with a $\overline{cba}$. We get: $$\begin{aligned}

Since the same amount of money has been subtracted from all amounts, the difference between the amounts of money given to Dorothea and Alma does not change and all options are viewed in the table. | Alma | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | ---------------------------- | | --- | | --- | --- | | Bruno | 2 2 2 2 4 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 8 10 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 | | Dorothea | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | | | | | | | the difference “Dorothea-Alma” | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | as seen, the biggest difference possible is $16$, but the smallest difference is $7$ cents.

Those businesspeople with eight dots on their backs always tell the truth, but those businesspeople with three dots on their backs always lie.

# # solution 6 bizaras sit on the windowsill. Let's justify that this is the only option. We look at the first three business lines. * They don't all speak the truth, because the statements of the second and third business lines are contradictory. * Nor can they all lie. Let's face it the other way, the first three businesspeople lie. So all the other businesspeople who say there's one out of the first three who doesn't lie lie lie, too. We get that all the businesswomen lie, but then the first businesswoman tells the truth that everyone has the same number of dots on their backs. We get a contradiction because all the businesswomen lie at the same time and the first one tells the truth, so the assumption is false. So of the first three businessmen, there are those who lie, and there are those who tell the truth. We get that the first businesswoman is definitely lying because the same number of dots means that either all the businesswomen are lying or everyone is telling the truth. So the truth is said by either the second or third businesswoman, but not both because their utterances are contradictory. This means that it is one of the first three businesswomen who tells the truth, so everyone else tells the truth and each has $8$ dots. The first three businesspeople have $8+3+3=14$ dots on their backs together. If the third businesswoman said the truth, then the remainers would have $48-14=34$ dots on their backs together, which is impossible because $34$ don't share $8$. So the truth is said by the second businesswoman and the remaining ones have $38-14=24$ dots together and besides the first three businesspeople there are even more $24∶8=3$ businesspeople. So there are $6$ businesspeople sitting together on the windowsill.

Because $AM$ is bisextre, then $\sphericalangle MAC = \frac{1}{2}\sphericalangle A = 30^{\circ} - x$. The angle $\sphericalangle AMH$ is the outside angle of the triangle $MCA$, hence the $\sphericalangle AMH = \sphericalangle MAC + \sphericalangle MCA = 30^{\circ} − x + x = 30^{\circ}$. This means that in a right-angle triangle, the $AHM$ catheter $AH$ is facing a $30^{\circ}$ angle, so it is equal to half the hypotenuse $AM$, or $AM = 2AH$.! [] (LV.AMO.2023.9.3A.png)

Dividing a table into rows corresponds to dividing into four groups of nine cards each, and by columns into nine groups of four cards each. In both cases, the sum of the numbers is the same for all groups, $27$ and $12$ respectively. Suppose you can divide these numbers into six groups of six cards each so that the sum of the numbers in all groups is the same. Then the sum of the numbers in each group must be $18$. With a total of eight cards with the number $9$, there will be more than one card with the number $9$ in at least one group on the Dirichlee principle. If there are two $9$ cards in a group, the sum of the numbers already written on those two cards is $18$ and the sum of the remaining four cards must be $0$, which is not possible because the lowest possible sum of four cards is $4 \cdot 1 = 4$. We have acquired a contradiction caused by the assumption that cards in six groups of six each with the same total number can be split.

# # Resolution * * (R) * * Yes, for example, see figure 18, where there is an adjacent number difference in grey. In that case, $$S = 3 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 100.$$! [] (LV.AMO.2023.9.5A.png) * * (B) * * * let's justify that the $S = 123$ cannot be obtained. Let's get this done by proving that $S$ always have to be an even number. If the first 16 subsistence numbers are arbitrarily arranged in the $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_{16}$, then we can express the sum $S$ as a $$S = |x_1 − x_2| + |x_2 − x_3| + |x_3 − x_4| + \cdots + |x_{15} − x_{16}| + |x_{16} − x_1|.$$, let's note that the $S$ would be 0 if the difference did not always have to be subtracted from the largest number, that is, the differences could allow negative values because everything in pairs would shorten: $$x_1 − x_2 + x_2 − x_3 + x_3 − x_4 + \cdots + x_{15} − x_{16} + x_{16} − x_1 = 0.$$ we just start to make sure that any of the negative differences in the amount are positive (the smallest is subtracted from the larger), then as a result we get that the 𝑆 goes up by the even number. If there is a negative difference in the amount in the $x_i − x_j$ where you $x_j > x_i$, and we want to make it a positive expression in the $x_j − x_i$ or $|x_i − x_j|$, then you add the $2(x_j − x_i)$, which is the even number, the $x_j − x_i = (x_i − x_j) + 2(x_j − x_i)$. If we turned each negative difference into a positive to result in $S$ as described in the terms of reference, then even numbers should be added gradually to the $0$. So no matter how the first $16$ subsistence numbers are arranged around the circle, the number $S$ always be the even number.

We note that three rectangular triangles are equally $\triangle ABE = \triangle CBF = \triangle CDF$ by the $h\ell$ of the characteristic: * $AB = CB = CD$ by given; * $\sphericalangle BAE = \sphericalangle BCF = \sphericalangle DCF = \alpha$. In that case, the $BE = BF = FD$, such as the corresponding elements of the same triangles, or $BE = \frac{1}{2}BD$, so that in a right-angle triangle, the $BED$ angle to the catheter, which is twice as short as the hypotenuse, is $30^{\circ}$ or $\sphericalangle BDE = 30^{\circ}$ and $\sphericalangle EBD = 60^{\circ}$. From the $𝐵𝐶𝐷$ of the equilateral triangle, we can express the basic angle in the $\sphericalangle DBC = (180^{\circ} − \sphericalangle BCD) ∶ 2 = 90^{\circ} − \alpha$. From the right-angle triangle $ABE$, we can express $\sphericalangle ABE = 180^{\circ} − \sphericalangle BAE − \sphericalangle AEB = 90^{\circ} − \alpha$.

This will result in three equilateral triangles: $\triangle ABB'$, $\triangle B'C'D$ and $\triangle CBD$. These triangles are the same with each other in terms of $m\ell{}m$, as their apex angles are the same between the $\sphericalangle B'AB = \sphericalangle BCD = \sphericalangle DC'B'$ and the sides. So the $\triangle BB'D$ is an equilateral triangle and $\sphericalangle B'BD = 60^{\circ}$. Because the $\triangle ABB'$ is equilateral, its base angle $\sphericalangle ABB'=90^{\circ} - \alpha$. Similarly, we can judge the basic angle of $\triangle CBD$ in $\sphericalangle CBD = 90^{\circ} - \alpha$. Now we look at the inner angle of the rectangle $ABCD$ in the $\sphericalangle ABC$. With the following, we get that it's $\sphericalangle ABC = 360^{\circ} − 7\alpha$ in size. On the other hand, it equals $$\sphericalangle ABB' + \sphericalangle B'BD + \sphericalangle CBD = 
90^{\circ} - \alpha + 60^{\circ} + 90^{\circ} - \alpha = 
240^{\circ} - 2\alpha$$ So $$360^{\circ} − 7\alpha = 240^{\circ} − 2\alpha \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \alpha = 24^{\circ}.$$

In this case, the $AE$ will be the diameter of the circle, as it is based on the right angle in the $\sphericalangle ABE$. In addition to removing the cut-off, we will mark the $AD$ and its intersection with $BC$ with $F$. The triangles in $\triangle ABF$ and $\triangle FCD$ are similar in character $\ell\ell$, as both are right-angled and $\sphericalangle AFB = \sphericalangle CFD$. It follows that, in $$\frac{AB}{BF} = \frac{CD}{CF}\;\;\Rightarrow\;\; 
\frac{2}{BF} = \frac{3}{FC} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\frac{2}{BF} = \frac{3}{5 - BF} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
BF = 2, CF=3.$$, the $\triangle CDF$ is therefore an equilateral right-angle triangle because it $CF = CD = 3$. So $\sphericalangle CDF = 45^{\circ}$. As the angle retracted in the ∢ 𝐴 𝐸 is based on the diameter $AE$, then $\sphericalangle ADE = 90^{\circ}$. It follows that, in $$\sphericalangle CDE = \sphericalangle ADE − \sphericalangle CDF = 90^{\circ} − 45^{\circ} = 45^{\circ}.$$, the $\triangle CDE$ is therefore also a rectangular equilateral triangle in which to $CD = CE = 3$. So the $BE = BF + CF + CE = 8$ and diameter $AE = \sqrt{8^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{68} = 2\sqrt{17}$. Consequently, the circle area $S = \frac{\pi{}AE^2}{4} = 17\pi$.! [] (LV.AMO.2023.11.3A.png)

Dividing a table into rows corresponds to dividing into eight groups of nine cards each, and columns into nine groups of eight cards each.

With a total of eight cards with the number $9$, there will be more than one card with $9$ in at least one group on the Dirichlee principle. If there are two cards with $9$ in the group, the sum of the remaining numbers on the $10$ cards must be $24 − 2 \cdot 9 = 6$, which is not possible because the lowest possible amount is $10 \cdot 1 = 10$.

If there is one card with a $9$ in the group, the sum of the remaining five numbers on the cards must be $12 − 9 = 3$, which is not possible because the lowest possible amount is $5 \cdot 1 = 5$.

# # resolve let us prove there is no resolution for this equation. To support this, we look at both sides of the equation by module $8$. An integer square after $8$ a module can only accept value $0$, $1$, or $4$ (see table). | $n$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | | --- | --- | | | $n^2 \pmod 8$ | 0 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | | So a number $17a^2$ after module 8 can only accept value $0$, $1$, or $4$ (because $17a^2 = 16a^2 + a^2$) and similarly, $−7b^2$ (the $−7b^2 = − 8b^2 + b^2$) can only accept those three balances. But the number $2023$, divided by $8$, gives the remainder to $7$. You can see that by totalling three numbers from a set $\{0; 1; 4\}$ in no way can we get a number that would give you $7$ in the remainder, divided by $8$. So there is no solution to this equation.

Through the dot, $C$ draws a cut-off $GH$ parallel to the edge of the square in the $BD$ (see Figure 23). The diagonal of the rectangle $ABCD$ divides the $BD$ area of the rectangle into two equal triangles for $ABD$ and $BCD$ whose areas are $S_{ABD} = S_{BCD} = \frac{ab}{2}$. Since the $BCD$ base of the triangle is the $BDHG$ edge of the $BD$ of the rectangle and the height of the triangle is equal to the $BG$ length of the edge of the rectangle, then $S_{BDHG} = 2S_{BCD} = ab$. Similarly, we get that $S_{CEF} = \frac{1}{2}S_{EFGH}$. Hence $$S_{CEF} = \frac{1}{2}S_{EFGH} = \frac{S_{BDEF} - S_{BDHG}}{2} =

# # Resolution * * (R) * * Let's try to the contrary, that is, color the boxes in a given square so that there is no rectangle with a size $2 \times 4$ box with no color boxes. Divide the entire area into squares with size $2 \times 2$ boxes, which we'll call cells (see Fig. 24, where each cell contains its number).! [] (LV.AMO.2023.12.4A.png) because each row and column contains exactly one box, each cell can have 0, 1, or 2 boxes. If two boxes are selected in a cell, the remaining cells in that row of cells and column of cells will be without color boxes, and at least two adjacent cells will have no color boxes, these cells will together form a $2 \times 4$ box rectangle without color boxes (contradiction with assumption). So you can color up to 1 box per cell. Because the $8$ boxes are color-coded, eight of the $16$ cells must have exactly one box color. Let's justify that if two cells with a colored box are next to each other, there will be two cells somewhere next to them with no colored boxes. Note that you can rotate the given square so that the two adjacent cells with the stained boxes are sequential numbers (the smallest number is odd), as shown in Figure 24. Then you can split the remaining cells sequentially into pairs, resulting in pairs of $7$ cells. To avoid a rectangle without colored boxes, you must color the box in at least every other cell. This means that you must mark at least $7$ in cells in the box, which is not possible because the remaining number of boxes to color is $6$. Thus, cells with stained boxes should be positioned in the form of a chessboard (see Figure 25).! [] because of the symmetry of (LV.AMO.2023.12.4B.png), we can assume that cell 1 contains a stained box. Let's look at cell 11 and assume that the box in it is on the left side of the cell (that is, column 3 of the original square). Either the box in cell 3 or cell 9 must be in column 6 (because only one box can be colored in the column), then the rectangle in $2 \times 4$ without colored boxes is shown in Fig. 26 and Fig. 27, respectively! [] (LV.AMO.2023.12.4C.png) the case where the box in cell 11 is on the right side of the cell is symmetrical, then the rectangle in $2 \times 4$ without colored boxes is shown in Fig. 28 and Fig. 29!

# # * * (R) * * Yes, for example, is the number $27$. It has four dividers: $1$, $3$, $9$ and $27$. The only divider that gives $1$ in the remainder when divided by $3$ is the remainder of the $1$ that makes up the $\frac{1}{4}$, or $25\%$, of the dividers. * * (B) * * Yes, exists, such as the number $3 \cdot 2^{24}$. Let us be guided by the fact that this number has the required attribute. This number collectively has $50$ dividers, because we can either omit each primary number when you create a divider or take it into one of the steps that do not exceed the level entering the number. So multiplier $3$ has $2$ choices and multipliers $2$ have $25$ choices. Together we get $2 \cdot 25 = 50$ choices or dividers. Half of these dividers are in the $3 \cdot 2^a$ form and the other half is in the $2^a$ form where you $a \in \{0; 1; 2; \ldots ; 24\}$. Dividers in the $3 \cdot 2^a$ form share $3$. Let's find out which of the dividers in the $2^a$ form, divided by $3$, give you the remainder of the $1$. We look at two cases. * If the climber $a$ is an even number, then $a = 2k$ and then $2^a = 2^{2k} = 4^k \equiv 1 \pmod 3$. So all these dividers, divided by $3$, give the remainder to $1$. Because even numbers are $13$ between $0$ and $24$ (inclusive), the number of such dividers is also $13$. * If the ascender $a$ is an odd number, then $a = 2k+1$ and then $2^a = 2^{2k+1} = 2 \cdot 4^𝑘 \equiv 2 \cdot 1^k \equiv 2 \pmod 3$. So all these dividers, divided by $3$, give the remainder to $2$. Their numbers are $12$. Because the number $3 \cdot 2^{24}$ has $50$ dividers, $\frac{13}{50} = 26\%$ of them give $1$ in the remainder, divided by $3$.
