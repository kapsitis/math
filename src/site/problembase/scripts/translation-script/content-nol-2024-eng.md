# # solve * * (R) * * No, it's impossible. Let's observe that after each action, the number of yellow tokens either doesn't change (this happens when you throw two zalus tokens or one zala and one yellow token into the machine) or it drops by $2$ (this happens when you throw two yellow tokens into the machine). Since the number of yellow tokens was an even number at first, it will also be an even number after any action. So it's impossible that the number of yellow tokens is $1$ (which is an odd number). * * (B) * * Yes, it's possible. Dagmara could do the following: first throw 2 yellow tokens (and saṇemt one green) into the machine 9 times, after 9 such actions, Vina would be left with $24$ green tokens and 2 yellow tokens. Then throw 2 green tokens into the machine 23 times, each time the machine would return a $1$ green token, which would result in the number of green tokens falling by $1$ each time. So she would end up with 2 yellow tokens and 1 green token left.

As all members share $x$ on the right side of $\operatorname{LKD}(b, c)=a+\operatorname{LKD}(a, b)-b$ and equality, so does $\operatorname{LKD}(b, c)$ share $x$. This means that $c$ also shares $x$, with lîdz also sharing $\operatorname{LKD}(a, c)$ with $x$. So we've proven that $\operatorname{LKD}(a, c)$ is sharing $\operatorname{LKD}(a, b)$. Similarly, we can prove that $\operatorname{LKD}(a, b)$ share $\operatorname{LKD}(a, c)$. We infer from this, the $\operatorname{LKD}(b, c)=\operatorname{LKD}(a, b)=x$ of $\operatorname{ka} \operatorname{LKD}(a, b)=\operatorname{LKD}(a, c)$ and symmetry. by placing it in the given equation, we get that $a+x=b+x=c+x$ or $a=b=c$.

You can choose the largest common divider of all three given skaiț ̣ as the $y$, and then look at the numbers in the $a_{1}, b_{1}$ and $c_{1}$ that meet the terms of reference and have the largest common divider of 1. As with option 1, we can get that if you $\operatorname{LKD}\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right)=x$, then the $c_{1}$ shares the $x$. But since the largest common divider of all numbers is 1, we conclude, $\operatorname{ka} \operatorname{LKD}\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right)=1$. Like we get, $\operatorname{kaKD}\left(b_{1}, c_{1}\right)=1$ and $\operatorname{LKD}\left(c_{1}, a_{1}\right)=1$. So $a_{1}+1=b_{1}+1=c_{1}+1$, or $a_{1}=b_{1}=c_{1}=1$.

# # solution * * (R) * * let's justify that $n=2024$ is not possible. Let's use evidence from the opposite. Let's just say we have 2,024 boxes of fruit that match the terms of reference. Since the boxes can be rearranged so that each next box contains one apple more than the previous one, we can conclude that the number of apples in this arrangement is $2024$ consecutive natural skaiț ̣ I. If we $a$ the smallest number of apples in a box, the highest number will be $a+2023$. We can also conclude that apples are $\frac{a+(a+2023)}{2} \cdot 2024=1012(2 a+2023)$ together. Similarly, we can judge pears, that is, if we label the smallest number of pears with $b$, then the total number of pears is 1,012 $(2 b+2023)$. It has also been given that these boxes can be arranged in such a way that the total number of fetuses forms a sequence of consecutive natural numbers. If we mark the smallest number of fruits with $k$, then the total number of fruits in all the boxes is $1012(2 k+2023)$ because the number of fruits in the boxes is consecutive natural skaiț ̣ I. We estimate that the total number of fruits will also be 1,012 $(2 a+2023)+1012(2 b+2023)=$ $=1012(2 a+2023+2 b+2023)$. So it must be that we $$
\begin{aligned}
1012(2 a+2023+2 b+2023) & =1012(2 k+2023) \\
2(a+b+2023) & =2 k+2023
\end{aligned}
$$ get a contradiction. The left-hand value of the equation is an even number, and the right-hand expression is an odd number. So the dairy is deluded and there's no way 2024 boxes are on the table. * * (B) * * let's show you how to create boxes of fruit so that the task's determinations are met if you $n=2025$'t. Let's put the fruit together so that both the number of apples and pears in the boxes will be all the subsistence skaiț ̣ I from 1 to 2025, while the total number of fruits in the boxes will be all the subsistence skaiți from $1014$ to $3038$. Let's line up the boxes in one row. How to assemble apples and pears into boxes is shown in the following table. | boxes #| 1. | 2. | 3. | $\ldots$ | 1013. | 1014 | 1015. | $\ldots$ | 2024. | 2025. | |: --- |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: | | | number of apples | 1 | 2 | 3 | $\ldots$ | 1013 | 1014 | 1015 | $\ldots$ | 2024 | 2025 | | | number of pears | 2025 | 2023 | 2021 | $\ldots$ | 1 | 2024 | 2022 | $\ldots$ | 4 | 2 | Total | 2026 | 2025 | 2024 | $\ldots$ | 1014 | 3038 | 3037 | $\ldots$ | 2028 | 2027 | First fold apples in each box so that the first box contains 1 apple and each subsequent box contains 1 apple more than the previous one (so there are 2,025 apples in the last box). Then we'll put 2,025 pears in the first box and 2 fewer pears in each next as far as the 1,013 th box we'll bend 1 pear into. Next in box 1014, let's put 2024 pears in and put 2 pears lower in each next box again than the previous one until we get to box 2025, which we put 2 pears in. It can be seen that in the first 1,013 boxes the number of foetuses ranges from $2026$ to $1014$ respectively (one less per subsequent box), while in the remaining $1012$ boxes it ranges from $3038$ to $2027$ respectively (one less per subsequent box).

So $B D_{1}=B D=1$ and $D E=D_{1} E_{1}=3$.

Maris and Kim arrive at a large candy box. Viṇi, the two pamǐšus ṇem out of the box candy, Maris starts first. In every move, a player can choose to patvalịgu a prime $p$ and a patchy whole nonnegative number for $n$ and Panemt from a box $p^{n}$ candy. That player wins, after whose move the box remains empty. Maris starts the game. Which player, playing properly, can always win if you initially have the following in the box: * * (A) * * $20$; * * (B) * * $2024$ candy?

# # is that Maris can win in both cases. Let's be clear that you can paṇemt $1$ in one go. $2$; $3$; $4$ or $5$ sweets, but you should not take 6, nor should you take the number of sweets, which is a $6$ multiple. So Maris can play in a way that shares the number of candy left with $6$ after a viṇa move. Since it's impossible to paṇemt the number of candy that coincides with some multiples of the number 6, Kim will always leave the number that won't share the $6$ after his move in a pile of candy. Considering that it is possible to take a $1$; $2$; $3$; $4$ or $5$ candy, then Maris will always be able to get the amount of candy left in the box to share with $6$ after his move. As $0$ shares $6$ (a situation where all candy panemates), Maris will always win with such a stratēǵiju. In the first move * * * (R) * *, Marim is jāpaṇem $2$ (or $8$) candy to keep $18$ (or $12$) candy left over. Also in * * (B) * * * 's first move, Maris can paṇemt $2$ candy to keep $2022$ candy shared with $6$ left over (Maris can also take another count of candy, such as $8 ; 32 ; 128 ; \ldots$, in his first move).

Find all predatory pairs for $(p;q)$ that run the same $p^{q}=q^{p}+7$.

# # We'll first note that both pirmskaiț ̣ I $p$ and $q$ cannot be even or odd numbers at the same time. If $p=q=2$, then $2^{2} \neq 2^{2}+7$. If both $p$ and $q$ had an odd number, then the $p^{q}$ would have an odd number, while the $q^{p}+7$ would have an even number, so the equation would not be true. In tādẹl, exactly one of the two numbers is 2, while the other is some odd prime. Let's look at the case if you $p=2$. So we have to find all the odd pirmskaiți $q$ to fulfil the equals in $2^{q}=q^{2}+7$. Here are two of the smallest $q$ values: * if $q=3$, then $2^{3}=9 \neq 16=3^{2}+7$; * If $q=5$, then $2^{5}=32=5^{2}+7$, so the $(2 ; 5)$ is a valid pair of numbers. To justify that there are no other solutions, let's show that for larger $q$ values, the left-hand expression of the equation is always larger than the right-hand expression, that is, that all natural $q \geq 7$ perform $2^{q}>q^{2}+7$. Let's use the mathematical induction method. * induction base. * If $q=7, \operatorname{tad} 2^{7}=128>56=7^{2}+7$. * inductive assumption. * assume that inequalities occur when $q=k \geq 7$, that is, $2^{k}>k^{2}+7$. * inductive transition. * Let's show that inequalities also apply when $q=k+1$, that is, $$2^{k+1}>(k+1)^{2}+7=k^{2}+2k+8$$ use the inductive assumption that $k \geq 7$, and evaluating expressions, taking into account that $2^{k}>k^{2}+7$: $$2^{k+1}=2 \cdot 2^{k}>2\left(k^{2}+7\right)=k^{2}+k^{2}+14 \geq k^{2}+7 k+14>k^{2}+2 k+8.$$ conclusion. Since inequality is true, if $q=7$, and it follows from the fact that inequality is valid, if $q=k$, that inequality is also valid in $q=k+1$, we conclude that inequality is valid for all natural numbers in $q \geq 7$. So the equation $2^{q}=q^{2}+7$ has no solution if $q \geq 7$. Let's look at the case if you $q=2$. So we need to find all the odd prime $p$ to meet the equals in $p^{2}=2^{p}+7$, or $2^{p}=p^{2}-7$. It is already known from the above that the šî uniformity is not valid for all $p \geq 7$, as this would $2^{p}>p^{2}+7>p^{2}-7$. It remains to check cases in $p=3$ and $p=5$. They both don't fit as $2^{p}=p^{2}-7$ solves of the equation because they $2^{3} \neq 3^{2}-7$ and $2^{5} \neq 5^{2}-7$. Consequently, the only valid pair of numbers is $(2;5)$. * Note: * the case, if $q=2$, can be justified by looking at this equation by module 4. Because of the $p \geq 3$, the $2^{p}+7 \equiv 0+$ $3 \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. Because the $p$ is an odd number, that is, $p=2n+1$ a natural number in the $n$, then $$p^{2} \equiv(2 n+1)^{2} \equiv 4 n^{2}+4 n+1 \equiv 1 \pmod {4}$. Because $1 \not \equiv 3 \pmod {4}$, there is no solution to the equation if $q=2$.
