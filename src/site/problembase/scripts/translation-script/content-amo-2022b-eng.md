What is the smallest positive integer that uses only the digits $0$ and $2$ in its notation and is divisible by $15$? 

<small>

* concepts:positive-integer,digit,decimal-notation,divisibility
* questionType: Findoptimal
* domain: NT
* LTopic: The resolution

</small> 

## Solution

We show that the smallest number satisfying the conditions is $2220$. 
For a number to be divisible by $15$, it must be divisible by 
$3$ and $5$. To be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $3$.
So the number $2$ must appear at least $3$ times in that number.

To be divisible by $5$, the last digit of this number must be $0$. 
Consequently, the smallest number with that property has at least $4$ digits and equals $2220$.

## Solution 

to divide viewership directly into three, five, and septiṇās daḷās, the number of bills sold must be divided by $3$, $5$, and $7$. So the number of bills sold should share $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7=105$. Since at least half of the bills were sold, $105 \cdot 2=210$ billets were sold.

The scales (a), (b) and (c) are known to be in balance. How many arrows should I put in place of a question mark so that the weights (d) are in balance? Justify answer!! [] (LV.AMO.2022B.5.4.png) 

<small>

* Concept: Equality
* questionType: FindAll
* domain: ALG
* LTopic: LTEquationSystems

</small> 

## Solution

We need to place six arrows instead of a question mark. 
Let's express the mass of all the figures in "arrow units". 
From the balance (c), we conclude that the mass of the circle is 
equal to the mass of four arrows. As a result, 
we can consider that the weights (b) have six arrows in the 
left cup that weigh as much as three squares. So the mass of one square is the same as the mass of two arrows. Here's a look at the scales (a). By replacing the circle with four arrows and each square with two arrows, we get that the mass of the pentagon and four arrows is the same as the mass of the ten arrows. So the mass of the pentagon is as much as the mass of six arrows.

Each of the three girls, Elina, Kung and Maruth, love one of the colors: green, yellow, orange (every other color), but don't like the other two colors. Exactly one of the claims is known to be true: * Kung doesn't like orange; * Elina doesn't like green; * Elina doesn't like orange. What colour does every girl like? Justify answer!

## Solution 

Kung likes orange, Elinas - Zala and Maruth - yellow. Clearly, 
at least one of the last two allegations is true, as Elina can't 
like both green and orange. With only one true statement together, 
the first statement is certainly false and Kung likes the orange. 
If Elina liked the yellow, then the two final statements 
would be true, which is impossible. Since Kung likes orange, 
we conclude that Elina likes the green. So Maruth loves the yellow.

<small>

* cooked: natural-numbers, divisibility
* questionType: Findcount

## Solution

ltdivisibility is that the $249$ numbers are surrounded by a zīmuḷiem of at least two colors. Whatever number is surrounded by a zīmuḷiem of at least two colors, you need to look at all numbers that share at least two of the given numbers in $3$, $5$, or $7$. If a number shares $3$ and $5$, it shares $15$. Because of the $2022=15 \cdot 134+12$, $134$ skaiți of all the numbers you typed are shared with the $15$. If a number shares $3$ and $7$, it shares $21$. Because you $2022=21 \cdot 96+6$, there are 96 numbers divided by 21 of all the numbers you typed. If a number shares $5$ and $7$, it shares $35$. Because you $2022=35 \cdot 57+27$, a $57$ number of all the numbers you typed is divided by the $35$. We note that there are several numbers that share $3$, $5$, and $7$ at the same time, so they also share $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7=105$. Because of the $2022 = 105 \cdot 19 + 27$, $19$ skaitḷi from all the written skaitḷiem are shared with the $105$. Skaitḷi that share $105$ are counted against numbers that share $15$, $21$, and $35$, so they count three times. We conclude that together there are $134+96+57-38 = 249$ numbers divided by at least two numbers, so they are surrounded by a zīmuḷiem of at least two colors.

On a dark autumn night, Maris figured out to add up all the subsistence numbers from $1$ to $n$, where $n$ has some subsistence figure. Can it happen that Maris got an amount whose last digit is **(A)** $8$, **(B)** $9$? 

<small>
* cooked: natural-numbers, sum, last-digit
* questionType: Provedisprove, ProveDisprove
* domain: NT
* LTopic: Ltcongruencemodulo
</small> 

## Solution 

**(A)**  
Yes, can, for example, be $1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. 

**(B)** 
No, cannot. Here's a look at the number sum $S_{n}$ for 
some $n$ values: 

* $S_{1}=1$ 
* $S_{2}=1+2=3$ 
* $S_{3}=1+2+3=6$ 
* $S_{4}=1+2+3+4=S_{3}+4=6+4=10$ 
* $S_{5}=1+2+3+4+5=S_{4}+5=10+5=15$ 
* $S_{6}=S_{5}+6=15+6=21$ 
* $\circ$... 

Let's create a table where I'll type the last digit in the 
skaitḷa $n$ and the last digit in the number amount $S_{n}$. 
We note that we get the last digit of the amount 
$S_{n}$ when we add the last digit of the previous 
amount to the last digit of the skaitḷa $n$. 

| the last digit of the number $S_{n}$ | the last digit of the amount $n$ | ---------------------------------------- | | | $\mathbf{1}$ | | $\mathbf{1}$ | | | | 2 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 3 | 4 | | | | | 5 5 | 6 | 1 | 7 | | | 8 | 8 | 9 5 | 0 0 0 1 | | | 4 | 5 | | 5 | | 0 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 3 | 8 | 1 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | $\mathbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{1}$ | 


Since the last digits of the number $n$ and 
amount $S_{n}$ in the last row of the table 
are the same as in the first, the values in the 
table below will start repeating periodically. 
The number $9$ is not in the second column 
of the table, so it cannot be the last digit of the amount.

## Solution

should put five aplǐši instead of question mark. Let's express the mass of all the figures in circles. From the balance of the instrument (c), we conclude that the mass of the pentagon is equal to the mass of four circles. We can therefore consider that the instrument (b) has six circles in the left cup, the mass of which is the same as the mass of three arrows. So the mass of one arrow is the same as the mass of two circles. Here's a look at the scales (a) below. By replacing the pentagon with four circles and each arrow with two circles, we get that the mass of the square and five circles is the same as the mass of the ten circles. So the square mass is as much as the mass of five circles.

## Solution 

In the village there are $21$ liars. 
Together, the $51+52+53+54+55+56+57=378$ answers “yes” were sanctioned. Let's note that every villager who tells the truth answered yes exactly once (for their favourite day) and every liar exactly six times (for all the days that aren't viṇa's favourite day). So if we turned one resident who says the truth into a liar, then in addition, we get five “redundant” answers yes. For a start, it pieṇemsim like everyone in the village was telling the truth, in which case we'd have to $273$ the answers “yes” directly together. Because we have $378$ answers to yes, we “seem” to have $378-273=105$ answers to yes. So we have to turn a $105:5=21$ villager into a meḷiem.

## Solution

can do what is required in $6$ ways. For a number to share $\overline{A869B}$ with a $15$, it must share both $3$ and $5$. Let's look at two possible cases in which a number can be typed instead of a $B$ to share a number with a $5$. * If you $B=0$, the sum of the number's digits is $A+8+6+9+0=A+23$. To share a number with a $3$, the sum of its digits must share a $3$, so the possible $A$ values are $1$, $4$, or $7$. * If $B=5$, the sum of the digits of the number must be $A+8+6+9+5=A+28$. To share a number with a $3$, the sum of its digits must share a $3$, so the possible $A$ values are $2$, $5$, or $8$. As a result, there are six different options that can be typed instead of $A$ and $B$: $A=1$ and $B=0$; $A=4$ and $B=0$; $A=7$ and $B=0$; $A=2$ and $B=5$; $A=5$ and $B=5$; $A=8$ and $B=5$.

## Solution 

can do what is required in $6$ different ways. For a number to $\overline{N597M}$ share 12, it must share both $3$ and $4$. To share a number with a $4$, its last two digits must be divided by a $4$. Let's look at two possible cases in which a number can be typed instead of a $M$ to share a number with a $4$. * If you $M=2$, the sum of the number's digits is $N+5+9+7+2=N+23$. To share a number with 3, the sum of its digits must share a $3$, so the possible $N$ values are $1$, $4$, or $7$. * If $M=6$, the sum of the digits of the number must be $N+5+9+7+6=N+27$. To dalítos a number to 3, the sum of its digits must share a $3$, so the possible $M$ values are $0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. Because a number cannot begin with a $0$, the possible $N$ values are $3$, $6$, or $9$. As a result, there are six different options that can be typed instead of $M$ and $N$: $N=1$ and $M=2$; $N=4$ and $M=2$; $N=7$ and $M=2$; $N=3$ and $M=6$; $N=6$ and $M=6$; $N=9$ and $M=6$.

## Solution 

the student correctly solved $6$ tasks. Let's just say it's the only valid value. We mark the number of tasks that have been resolved correctly with the number of $x$ and missolved tasks with the $y$. We $$8x-5y=13$$ the equation because the $8x$ is an even number, then the $5y$ is definitely an odd number because the difference must be 13. So $y$ is an odd number. By expressing $x$ from the $8x-5y=13$ of equality, we get $x=(13+5y):8$. We note that there were 20 tasks in total, so only 6 different $y$ values that are shown in the table are $x+y \leq 20$ and possible. If $y \geq 12$, then $x>9$ and $x+y>20$. If the calculated $x$ value is a natural number, the resulting $x$ and $y$ values are valid. The table shows that the only valid values are $x=6$ and $y=7$, so the student correctly solved 6 tasks, incorrectly solved $7$ tasks, and $7$ tasks were not solved. | $\boldsymbol{y}$ | is $\boldsymbol{x}=(\mathbf{1 3}+\mathbf{5} \boldsymbol{y}): \mathbf{8}$ a natural number? | |: ---: |: ---: | | | $\mathbf{1}$ | No | | | $\mathbf{3}$ | No | | $\mathbf{5}$ | No | $\mathbf{7}$ | Yes, $x=6$ | Jā | No | $\mathbf{9}$ | No | No | $\mathbf{11}$ | No |

## Solution 

as $AD=BD$, the triangle $ABD$ is an equilateral triangle with a base $AB$ and its base anchor is the same, hence $\sphericalangle ABD=\sphericalangle BAD=\alpha$ (see Figure 6). We get from the triangle $ABD$ that we're $\sphericalangle ADB=180^{\circ}-\alpha-\alpha=180^{\circ}-2 \alpha$. We're watching $\sphericalangle ADC=180^{\circ} - \sphericalangle ADB=180^{\circ}-\left(180^{\circ}-2 \alpha\right)=2 \alpha$ as blakusleṇki. Since the $AC=DC$, the triangle in the $ACD$ is also equilateral and its basic pieleṇki are the same, hence the $\sphericalangle DAC=\sphericalangle ADC = 2\alpha$. Since the $AB=AC$, the triangle in the $ABC$ is also equilateral and its basic pieleṇki are the same, hence the $\sphericalangle ABC=\sphericalangle ACB=\alpha$. From the triangle $ACD$, we get that by $$\sphericalangle ADC+\sphericalangle DAC+\sphericalangle ACD = 2 \alpha+2 \alpha+\alpha=180^{\circ}$$ Atrising Equation $5 \alpha=180^{\circ}$, we get that $\alpha=36^{\circ}$.

So they should be written omitting one position (see figure 7, where the letters indicate the places where these numbers are to be entered). You can type the number $7$ next to only the number $2$ because their difference is $5$, but you cannot type it next to the other numbers in the circle in the $0$. $1$; $8$ or $9$, so the numbers given cannot be written in such a way that every two adjacent skaitḷi will be $3$; $4$ or $5$.

<small>

## Solution 

Is that there are 10 numbers that meet the terms of the task: $1881$, $2772$, $3663$, $4554$, $5445$, $6336$, $7227$, $8118$, $9009$, $9999$. For a number to share $99$, it must share both $11$ and $9$. We note that the given number is divided by the $11$ because the difference between the amount of digits in odd positions and the amount of digits in even positions is the $(A+B)-(B+A)=0$ divided by the $11$. To share a number with a $9$, the sum of its digits must share a $9$. So $A+B+B+A=2(A+B)$ should share the $9$. Since $A$ and $B$ are numbers, two cases are possible: $A+B=9$ or $A+B=18$. If $A+B=9$, there may be nine anniversaries: $$A+B=1+8=2+7=3+6=4+5=5+4=6+3=7+2=8+1=9+0$$ If you $A+B=18$, you can only have one year in a $A+B=9+9$.

We notice that we $x-y>0$ and $x y-9>0$ because after the given $x>y>3$. We look at the product of two positive expressions and modify their equivalents: $$0 < (xy-9)(x-y)=x^{2}y - xy^{2} -9x + 9y$$ So we got what we need.

We $BHC$ from the triangle that the $\sphericalangle HCB=180^{\circ}-\sphericalangle CHB-\sphericalangle HBC=90^{\circ}-\beta=\alpha$, hence the triangle $COB$, is an equilateral triangle because two of its leṇki are equally $\sphericalangle OBC=\sphericalangle OCB=\alpha$. It follows that it $BO = OC$ like the sides of an equilateral triangle. We get from the triangle $KCB$ that we $\sphericalangle BKC=180^{\circ}-\sphericalangle KCB-\sphericalangle KBC =  90^{\circ}-\alpha=\beta$. We notice the $\sphericalangle ACH=\sphericalangle ACB-\sphericalangle HCB=90^{\circ}-\alpha=\beta$. So the triangle in the $KOC$ is equilateral because two of its curves are equally $\sphericalangle OKC=\sphericalangle KCO = \beta$ and its side edges are the same $CO=OK$. From the equals $BO=OC$ and $CO=OK$, we get that the $BO=OK$, hence the $CH$, divides the cut-off $BK$ into two equal daḷās! [] (LV.AMO.2022B.9.3A.png)

## Solution 

**(A)** let's justify that the requested is not possible. Let us note that the skaitḷi $1$; $2$; $3$; $11$; $12$ and $13$ cannot be written next to each other because the difference between the two numbers is not $3$; $4$ or $5$. They must therefore be written by omitting a single position, so that only two adjacent places are created where no numbers are recorded (see Figure 10). You can type 4 next to only $1$ because their difference is $3$, but you can't type it next to the other numbers you've already typed in $2$. $3$; $11$; $12$ or $13$. So you have to type a number $4$ into one of the two adjacent vacancies. You can type a number $10$ next to only 13, but you cannot type it next to the other numbers in the circle in the $1$. $2$; $3$; $11$ or $12$. So you have to type 10 in one of the two adjacent vacancies. It follows that skait | us 4 and 10 should be written side by side, but there is a contradiction with the terms of the task because their difference is $6$. The figures given cannot therefore be written in such a way that each two adjacent skaitḷi differs by $3$; $4$ or $5$. * * (B) * * Yes, for example, see figure 11, recording inside the rink how different the numbers are.

**(B)** 
let us demonstrate that the required route cannot be established. Let's color the rectangular boxes in the shape of a chessboard and note that this color has a characteristic: adjacent boxes have different colors. Pieṇemsim the opposite that the required route exists. Because the route passes through all boxes with odd numbers, the transition from one color rūtiṇas to another color rūtiṇu occurs even more times. Consequently, the route will end in the same color rūtiṇā as the route start box. However, this cannot be the case because the boxes are next to the box where the route started. As a result, there is a contradiction and therefore no such route exists.

# # solve the last digit of a number by looking at the number given by moduḷa 10. Let's see that $2022^{2022} \equiv 2^{2022}(\bmod 10)$. So we need to find out the last digit of the number $2^{2022}$. String $2^{n}, n=1,2, \ldots$, is recurring by moduḷa $10$, let's look at the first members of this string: * if $n=1$, then $2^{1} \equiv 2 \pmod {10}$; * if $n=2$, then $2^{2} \equiv 4 \pmod {10}$; * if $n=3$, then $2^{3} \equiv 8 \pmod {10}$; * if $n=4$, then $2^{4} \equiv 16 \equiv 6 \pmod {10}$; * If $n=5$, then $2^{5} \equiv 32 \equiv 2 \pmod {10}$. You can easily summarize this information in the following table: | $n$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | $\ldots$ | |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: |: ---: | | $2^{n} \pmod {10}$ | redzam | $\mathbf{2}$ | 4 | 8 | 6 | $\mathbf{2}$ | $\ldots$ | We see that a string of $2^{n}(\bmod 10)$ is recurring with a period length of $4$. Because $2022=4 \cdot 505+2$, the last digit of the 2022 Member of the string will be the same as the last digit of the 2 nd locekḷa of the string, so the last digit will be $4$. As a result, we have obtained that the last digit of the number $2022^{2022}$ is $4$. the resolution of 
# # will clear the last digit of the number by looking at the number given by moduḷa $10$. Given that we $2^{4} \equiv 16 \equiv 6(\bmod 10)$ and $6^{n} \equiv 6(\bmod 10)$, we get the $$2022^{2022} \equiv 2^{2022} \equiv 2^{2020} \cdot 2^{2} \equiv\left(2^{4}\right)^{505} \cdot 4 \equiv 6 \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \pmod {10}$$, so we get that the last digit of the number $2022^{2022}$ is $4$.

Because the radius is perpendicular to the touches and the triangle is taisnleṇka in the $ACB$, the rectangular ONCM has a straight $\sphericalangle NCM=\sphericalangle CNO=\sphericalangle CMO=90^{\circ}$ for three leṇki. The two adjacent edges of the rectangle $ONCM$ are the same $ON=OM$ as the radius, so the rectangle in the $ONCM$ is square and $MC=OM=3 \mathrm{~cm}$, $CB=BM+MC=7 \mathrm{~cm}$.

# # solution First let's justify that of any three Members at least two have shaken hands with each other. Pieṇemsim the contrary that three Members have not made any handshakes between themselves. Let's take any two of them, then together they've made ̌ I's biggest four handshakes (each with two remaining MPs) - a contradiction. (1) Secondly, let us state that each Member has made at least two handshakes. Let's just say the opposite that some MP has only done one (or no) handshake. Let us mark this Member with a $X$ and one of the Members to whom he did not shake hands, let us sign Mr Y. the Member $X$ has shaken his hand no more than once and the Member $Y$ no more than three times (because he did not shake hands with the Member in $X$), so together they have shaken hands no more than 4 times - a contradiction. (2) Thirdly, let us note that if two Members did not shake hands with each other, at least one of them shook hands with all three others. (If the pair had any “omitted” handshake, then the pair would have the biggest $2+2=4$ handshakes together). (3) Pieṇemsim that two Members did not shake hands with each other (if they all shook, then they could be placed in patrol) and put them in places in $A$ and $C$ (see Figure 14), let's put in place the $C$ who shook hands with everyone else (of (3) that is certainly the case). In the future, we will refer to these two Members as $A$ and $C$.!

If the $A$ has not shaken hands with another Member, then let us put it in place of the $E$. (and let's call the Members' $E$ below). MP $A$ has certainly shaken hands with the two remaining MPs (otherwise he would have done just one handshake). MEP $E$ has certainly shaken hands with at least one of the remaining two MPs (otherwise $E$ would have done just one handshake), let's put this MP in place in $D$. It is evident that what has been demanded has been achieved with this. 
# # solve, let us see that if any Members did not shake hands with each other, then they hate each other. It follows from the above that if any two Members hate each other, then together the two viṇi hate another larger one. It's easy to see from this that a Member can hate the biggest two other members. Our job is to put them around the table so that two who hate each other don't sit next to each other. Pieṇemsim there is an MP who hates two other MPs. Let's put this MP in place A (see Figure 14) and those he hates -- places in $C$ and $D$ (Let us refer to these Members as $A, C$ and $D$, respectively). Let's note that all three of these MPs don't hate either of the other two. Indeed, since $A$ and $C$ hate each other and $A$ hate $D$, they ($A$ and $C$) can't hate anyone else anymore. The same judgment may also be given in respect of $A$ and $D$. So by putting the two remaining members in seats in $B$ and $E$, what has been demanded has been achieved. It remains to be seen where every Member hates the biggest one other Member. Then we have the biggest two pairs of MPs who hate each other by landing them not side by side (e.g. in places in $A$ - $C$ and $B$ - $D$) the demands will have been made.

# # Resolution the Museum Manager can create the described route for all $m;n \geq 2$ values for which at least one of the $m$ or $n$ shares 2. Here are three cases. 1. If you $m=2$ and $n \geq 2$, turn the rectangle so that the $m=2$ has the number of rows. So the first part of the route leads from the bottom left corner to the bottom right corner (the entire bottom row), further to the top right corner and then the top left corner (the entire top row). You can see that the route satisfies the task names. 2. If the $m>2$ shares $2$ and $n>2$, let's rotate the rectangle so that the $m=2 k(k \geq 2)$ has the number of rows. To construct a route that satisfies task nosacijums, we implement a rūtiṇu coordinate system in $(m;n)$ where the $m$ - row number, $n$ - column number and $(1;1)$ is the lower left corner. Here's a look at a route that connects the following boxes consecutively within one row or column: * $(i ; 2)$ with $(i ; n)$ * $(i ; n)$ with $(i+1 ; n)$ * $(i+1 ; n)$ with $(i+1 ; 2)$ * $(i+1 ; 2)$ with the $(i+2 ; 2)$ where the $i$ is sequentially equal to the $\{1;3;5;\ldots;m-1=2 k-1\}$. The engineered route will close in the $(m;2)$ box. We then take the route to the $(m;1)$ and $(1;1)$ the first column accordingly. You can see that the route satisfies the task condition. An example of the route is shown in Figure 16 with values $m=4$ and $n=5$.! [] (LV.AMO.2022B.11.5A.png) 3. If both $m$ and $n$ do not share the $2$ ($m;n \neq 1$), let us demonstrate that the required route cannot be established. Let's color a rectangular rūtiṇas in the shape of a chess galdiṇa and note that such a color has a characteristic: adjacent boxes have different colors. Let's say otherwise that the required route exists. As the route passes through all bitters with odd numbers, the transitions from one rūtiṇas to another occur a number of times. Consequently, the route will end in the same colour rūtiṇā as the starting rūtiṇa. But that can't be the case if that rūtiṇas is next door because they should be in different colors. Consequently, there is a contradiction and no such route exists. Since variable $m$ and $n$ can be changed in context for places, all possible cases are considered.

Let's look at what can be the sum of two integer cubes of a congruent by moduḷa 9. | $a^{3} \pmod 9$ | -1 | 0 | 1 | | |: ---: |: --- |: --- |: --- | | $b^{3} \pmod 9$ | -2 | -1 | 0 | | -1 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | | | | | | | Now we're looking at what can be the sum of congruent three whole skaitḷu cubes by MODULA 9. | $a^{3}+b^{3} \pmod 9$ | -1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | -2 | 2 |: ---: |: --- |: --- |: --- |: --- |: --- | | | -1 | -2 | -1 | 0 -3 | 1 | 0 | -1 | 0 | 1 | -2 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | -1 | 3 | We have obtained that the sum of three such skaițu after moduḷa 9 may yield any of the values $-3 ;-2 ;-1 ; 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3$ and none. Because the $2023^{2} \equiv 7^{2} \equiv 4 \equiv-5 \pmod 9$ does not appear between these values, the sum of three whole skaitḷu cubes cannot be $2023^{2}$.

# # will represent the root of the square equation with $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. After Viet's theorem, $x_{1} x_{2}=p$ and $x_{1}+x_{2}=-1$ are known. Using the sum square formula, we can calculate that the sum of the $$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)^{2}-2 x_{1} x_{2}=1-2p.$$ Sakṇu cubes can be expressed as the $$x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)\left(x_{1}^{2}-x_{1} x_{2}+x_{2}^{2}\right)=-1(1-2 p-p) = 3p-1 = -16.$$ So $3p=-15$ and $p=-5$.

In the triangle, the length of the height drawn $ABC$ from the $A$ of the summit is $1$, the length of the median drawn from the $C$ of the summit is also $1$ and the length of the $B$ of the height from the summit is $\sqrt{3}$. What can be the area of this triangle?

# # solution will mark the midpoint of the $AB$ with a $M$ and remove perpendiculars in the $MP$ and $MT$ against the edges in the $AC$ and $BC$, respectively. The foundations of height drawn from the peaks in $A$ and $B$ shall be marked with $Q$ and $N$ respectively. Because the $MT \| AQ$, the $MT \perp BC$ and the $AQ \perp BC$, the $M T$ is the centerline of the triangle $A Q B$, hence the $M T=\frac{1}{2} A Q=\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, we get that $M P=\frac{1}{2} B N=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. We notice that the taisnleṇça in the triangle $MTC$'t work, that the $\sin \Varangle MCT=\frac{M T}{M C}=\frac{1}{2}$, hence the $\Varangle M C T=30^{\circ}$. Similarly, we get that the taisnleṇka in the triangle $MPC$'t work, that the $\sin \Varangle M C P=\frac{M P}{M C}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, hence the $\Varangle M C P=60^{\circ}$. Here's a look at possible $\Varangle MCB$ values: * If the $T$ is on the $BC$, then $\Varangle M C B=30^{\circ}$; * If the $T$ is on the $BC$ extension, $\Varangle M C B=150^{\circ}$. As $\Varangle ACB=\Varangle MCA+\Varangle MCB$, it is not possible to $\Varangle MCB=150^{\circ}$ because the $\Varangle A C B$ will be equal to or greater than the $180^{\circ}$ at any $\Varangle M C B$ value. It follows that $\Varangle MCB=30^{\circ}$. Here's a similar look at possible $\Varangle MCA$ and $\Varangle ACB$ values: * If the $P$ is in the $AC$, then $\Varangle M C A=60^{\circ}$ and $\Varangle A C B=90^{\circ}$ * if the $P$ is on the $AC$ extension, then $\Varangle MCA = 120^{\circ}$ and $\Varangle A C B=150^{\circ}$. If $\Varangle ACB=90^{\circ}$ (see Figure 17), the heights from the peaks $A$ and $B$ coincide with the catheters $AC$ and $BC$, so in the $$S_{ABC}=\frac{AC \cdot BC}{2}=\frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{2}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$ If $\Varangle ACB=150^{\circ}$ (see Figure 18), we look at the right-angle triangle in the $AQC$ in which you $\Varangle A C Q=30^{\circ}$, hence the $\frac{A Q}{A C}=\sin \Varangle A C Q=\frac{1}{2}$. It follows that $A C=2 \cdot A Q=2$ and $$S_{ABC}=\frac{AC \cdot BN}{2}=2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=\sqrt{3}.$$ the area of the triangle may therefore be $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ or $\sqrt{3}$.!

# # releases both sides of the equation with the $5$: $$\frac{3}{5} \sin x+\frac{4}{5} \cos x=\frac{6}{5}.$$, let's have a narrow leṇki $\alpha$ like this that $\sin \alpha=\frac{4}{5}$. In this case, we can rewrite the $\cos \alpha=\sqrt{1-\sin ^{2} \alpha}=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{2}}=\frac{3}{5}$ and equation as $$\begin{gathered}
\sin x \cos \alpha+\cos x \sin \alpha=\frac{6}{5} \\
\sin (x+\alpha)=\frac{6}{5}
\end{gathered}$$ because the sinus values do not exceed 1, then there are no solves for this equation. So there's no solution for the given equation either. the 
# # solution by using double-leṇka formulas and $\cos ^{2} \frac{x}{2}+\sin ^{2} \frac{x}{2}=1$, we get that by dividing the two sides of the equation in the $$\operatorname{ctg}^{2} \frac{x}{2}-3 \operatorname{ctg} \frac{x}{2}+5=0$$ by $2 \sin ^{2} \frac{x}{2} \neq 0$, we get a square equation for the $t^{2}-3 t+5=0$ whose discriminant $D=(-3)^{2}-4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5=-11<0$, so there's no sakṇu for the square equation, so there's no solution for the equation given. the 
# # solution from both sides of the equation atṇemot the $4 \cos x$, we get you to $3 \sin x=6-4 \cos x$. By pushing both sides of the equation into a square, we get that by using a $\sin ^{2} x=1-\cos ^{2} x$ in the $$\begin{gathered}
9\left(1-\cos ^{2} x\right)=36-48 \cos x+16 \cos ^{2} x \\
9-9 \cos ^{2} x=36-48 \cos x+16 \cos ^{2} x \\
25 \cos ^{2} x-48 \cos x+27=0
\end{gathered}$$, we get a $\cos x=t$ of square equations with a discriminant $D=(-48)^{2}-4 \cdot 25 \cdot 27=48 \cdot 48-50 \cdot 54<0$, so that the square equation has no sakṇu, so that the equation has no roots. the 
# # solution will prove that the inequality in the $a \sin x+b \cos x \leq \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$ runs. Let's climb both sides of the equation into a square and use that $\sin ^{2} x+\cos ^{2} x=1$. We get that $$\begin{gathered}
(a \sin x+b \cos x)^{2} \leq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)\left(\sin ^{2} x+\cos ^{2} x\right) \\
a^{2} \sin ^{2} x+2 a b \sin x \cos x+b \cos ^{2} x \leq a^{2} \sin ^{2} x+a^{2} \cos ^{2} x+b^{2} \sin ^{2} x+b^{2} \cos ^{2} x \\
0 \leq a^{2} \cos ^{2} x-2 a b \sin x \cos x+b^{2} \sin ^{2} x \\
(a \cos x-b \sin x)^{2} \geq 0
\end{gathered}$$ because inequality is true to any $a, b$ and $x$ value, then the initial inequality in $a \sin x+b \cos x \leq \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$ is true. It follows that the $3 \sin x+4 \cos x \leq \sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=5$, and therefore the equation given, is sakṇu.

The table $n \times n$ is checked. Ilmari and Kim play such a game. They type a number $1$ or $-1$ in a box that is still empty. Ilmari starts the game. If a row or column is filled in after a player's move, the product of the numbers in the row or column is calculated. If it equals $-1$ then the player who made the last move gets a $1$ point (If a player completes both a row and a column at the same time with his move, and the product of each number is $-1$, then he scores twice). The game ends when the table is fully populated. The player who gets the most points wins. Which player has a winning strategy if * * (R) * * $n = 2021$; * * (B) * * $n = 2022$?

# # solution * * (R) * * If $n=2021$, Ilmari wins. On his first move, he records a number in the centre box for $-1$, but plays symmetrically in the far walks relative to central Ruthin and Kim's move. In that case, if Kim scores a point after his move, Ilmari will also symmetrically score. So Ilmari will score just as much as Kim. In addition, we can note that Ilmari will be the one who will fill the middle row and middle column on the basis of symmetry. Since all skaitḷi will be symmetrical in them, izṇemot the fact that a $-1$ has been recorded in between, we can conclude that the product will be $-1$ and Ilmari will score extra $2$ points that will allow him to win. * * (B) * * If $n=2022$, Kim wins. He ̌ makes each of his moves symmetrically against the vertical axis of symmetry of the table and Ilmari's, izṇemot the moments when the viṇam has to make a move in a row with exactly one empty box remaining. At those moments, he chooses a number so that the product of that line is $-1$. The son of symmetry, Kim will always be the one to fill a line, and this stratēǵija will guarantee a viṇam 2,022 points per row. In addition, we can note that every time the llmar fills a column, Kim will fill the symmetric column in the next move. As a result, Ilmari will fill in exactly the $1011$ columns that give the viṇam no more than $1011$ points. So Kim will win.
