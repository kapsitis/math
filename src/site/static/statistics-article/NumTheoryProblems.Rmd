**Abstract:** In this article we study olympiad problems in number theory (NT) 
offered in Latvia and Estonia. We compare the olympiad papers 
by grade and sort them by these attributes:

* **skills** - ability to perform certain groups of tasks,
* **question type** - what is the required result. Is 
it a proof for a general case, a proof by providing a counterexample, 
finding all numbers satisfying some statement, etc.), 
* **genre** a narrower category that often implies the question type
such as integer equations, analyzing adversarial games, filling a table,
* **concepts** appearing in the problem (for example, problems 
mentioning prime numbers, greatest common divisors, floor function). 

## Introduction

Secondary schools and gymnasiums in Latvia and Estonia share many similarities. 
* Primary education (Grades 1-6, typically for 7-13 year olds) is a prerequisite for 
secondary education. Some olympiads and competitions target this age group 
(for example, [Latvian Open Mathematical Olympiad](http://nms.lu.lv/in-english/en-mathematical-contests/#AMO) 
includes grades 5-6). This study only includes problems starting from Grade 7. 
* Secondary education has 2 levels - lower secondary is Grades 7-9 (ages 14-16), 
upper secondary is Grades 10-12 (ages 17-19).
* Various NT concepts (divisibility, remainders, 
prime numbers, lcd and gcm, decimal notation) are already covered in Grades 5-6, 
so the "theory" part in the number theory problems is almost the same for
Grades 7-12. 
* Olympiads in Latvia and in Estonia follow a similar pattern. It starts with the 
regional tour followed by the national tour (both events limit the number of 
participants; in particular, only the highest scoring students from the regional 
tours may enter the national tour). In addition, there is the open tour
(in Estonia there are even two open tours per year), where everyone 
can participate. 

**Existing guidelines:**  

Most olympiad papers in Latvian and Estonian olympiads
(regional, national and open tours) have 5 problems. On average, 
each olympiad paper has 1 NT problem (others are on geometry, algebera, 
combinatorics and/or "school problems").

1. Junior grades do not get NT problems that use some advanced concepts 
that are mostly covered after Grade 9 (geometrical progressions, 
exponential functions or logarithms, floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$).
2. Problems involving ellipsis or sum notation 
such as $F(1) + F(2) + \ldots + F(n)$ or $\sum_{k=1}^nF(k)$.
3. Steps that introduce a higher level of abstraction. For 
example, problem using the "regular" rule of divisibility by $9$ ($9$ divides
a number if and only if $9$ divides the sum of its digits) is fine for 
all grades 7-12, but a generalization (each number $n$ is congruent to the sum of 
its digits modulo $9$) is only used for grades 10-12.

The goal of this paper is to find empirical evidence of other differences
caused by conscious or unconscious choices of the problem selection committees
in both countries. This would be necessary to plan curricula for additional 
training in the number theory for different age groups.

## Skills for "Junior" and "Senior" NT Problems


## Differences by Question Type

    * **Find.All** - Find all objects satisfying the condition 
and prove that there are no others. In some problems the question 
implicitly assumes that the number was unique (for example, "Which was 
the number guessed by Joe?", EE.LVT.2016.noorem.2). 
Still, a full solution would need to prove the uniqueness of the answer. 
The objects to find may also differ. They may be 
integer numbers, pairs or $n$-tuples of integer numbers, 
series of moves to achieve some result, sequences or solutions to 
functional equations.
    * **Prove.Exists** - Typically this requires a constructive proof, but the question
is about the fact of existence rather than finding an example. Sometimes 
the object that should exist is a natural or integer number. A pair of numbers or 
even a path. 
    * **ProveDisprove.Exists** - In this case 

## Differences by Genre

## Differences by Concepts

5 categories - only junior concepts; predominantly junior, mixed, 
predominantly senior, only senior. 

## Conclusions

1. NT problems offered to senior students (grades 10-12) need more skills compared
to the NT problems offered to junior students (grades 7-9); in fact the former
skills are a proper superset.
2. Question types and genres differ more strongly by country (Latvia vs Estonia)
than by age. There are
certain "national traditions" how the olympiad problems in NT are formulated.
3. The concepts used in junior grades are partly replaced
